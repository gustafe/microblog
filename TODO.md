# TODO

## better fragment ids

Now: date + running ID: `2022-05-25_04`

Would like: date + slug + running ID: `2022-05-25_slug_04`

Current formats:

```
2022-05-24 Tuesday, 24 May 2022        -> 2022-05-24_tuesday
2005-11-22 observations for 2005-11-22 -> 2005-11-22_observations
2007-03-28 tweets for 2007-03-28       -> 2007-03-28_tweets
2022-05-25 That's all, folks!          -> 2022-05-25_thats_all_folks
```
