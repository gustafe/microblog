### Oderint dum metuant

This saying, attributed to Caligula, can be translated as "let them hate, as long as they fear". It is a good summary of the current Russian "imperial project", such as it is. There does not seem to be any benefit to being ruled by Russia, apart from an abstract belonging to the Russian empire. No benefits accrue to even parts of the conquered. The material fruits of labor will be confiscated. The weak will be harassed and violated. The conquered culture will be replaced by Russian culture.
