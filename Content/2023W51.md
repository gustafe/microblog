In this story by Katie Notopoulos, she explains that the reason substack hosts Nazis isn't necessarily because they like Nazis, it's because they made a bet that hosting Nazis would make them money. It also includes a link to a support letter by substackers who are ok with substack hosting Nazis. This is an excellent list of who to avoid reading and whose site to flag and block from link sharing sites.
