### Evangelical protestants with extra steps

"Yo Catholic Church, I'm a recent convert! Love the Latin, the architecture (so like the anime I watch) and of course I'm fully on board with the oppression of females. But I don't like the Pope going on about social justice. Can we just skip that?"

"Actually obeying the Pope is part of being a good Catholic."

"Urgh fine I'll just find a new Pope then."

> ME: hey, my car broke down. what saint should i pray to for help  
  TRADCATH WEIRDO: Uhhhhhh the virgin mary. Saint God  
  ACTUAL CATHOLIC: Idk man St. Christopher if the motor turns over and St. Frances of Rome if it doesn't, good luck

This week's entertainment is seeing web3 dweebs run headfirst into OFAC sanctions and whine impotently about "code is law" and "privacy".

You help NORKs launder money, you get rekt. Enjoy being in prison.
