> Don't call what you're wearing an outfit  
  Don't ever say your car is broke  
  Don't sing with a fake British accent  
  Don't act like your family's a joke

We caught this on SVT streaming. Recommended. A bit formulaic (young female police gets assigned cold case because a podcast is stirring things up) but the acting and setting is good. Nice twists too. 

A negative for the crappy sound mixing. Speech was muted compared to other audio.

For all my criticisms of Lucas as an artist and director, he seems like a decent human being.
