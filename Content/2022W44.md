Not surprised seeing cryptobros misunderstanding what a Veblen good is when they're advising Felon on how to price Twitter Verified checkmarks. These are the people who tried to sell butt-ugly monkey JPGs as Veblen goods, after all.

### Meta note on timestamps

I have discovered once again that the timestamp scheme I came up with when I created feed support was not optimal (The design principle was "LOL YOLO"). So I've changed it and thus (probably) updated all entries in all feed readers. Sorry about that. I hope it won't happen again.

(It will happen again.)

Automatically posting stuff from here to Fedi is coming along nicely. 

(and yes this post *might* be seen as a test of that functionality)

It's not ready yet though, it's getting late and I don't code good when tired.

### Fediverse integration

I whipped up a small tool that will poll this blog's feed and post new entries to a fediverse instance.

Because this blog doesn't have comments, feel free to rant in replies to those posts.

*Edit* it turns out that this is the 10,000th entry to this blog! Go me.

Surprising (not surprising) to see the same people who were Very Wrong about Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine being Very Wrong about what to do about Twitter.
