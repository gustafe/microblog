### Advent of Code 2022!

It's started. You can now post completion updates to Mastodon, which is appreciated.

I'm looking to whether I can be bothered to compile a blog entry for each day, like [earlier](https://gerikson.com/blog/comp/adventofcode/Advent-of-Code-2021.html).

*Update 2022-12-10:* you can follow comments on the [project README](https://github.com/gustafe/aoc2022/blob/main/README.md#advent-of-code-2022).

🐦 Twitter displays a tweet from the current POTUS denouncing anti-semitism and Hitler. The first reply I'm shown says "Worst POTUS ever". I'd have thought that would have been FDR for that doofus.

I don't know if it's a regional thing for me but basically all en.Wikipedia articles about cars I read use UK English for body styles: saloon, estate, panel van. I quite like it.

Other countries: our independence was won during the warmer months when people had the energy to gather in mobs. 

Finland: our independence was won in the depths of Winter, wrested from the cold hands of a dying Empire. 

## Hyvää itsenäisyyspäivää!

Another country that counts its independence from 6 Dec is the Republic of Ireland, 100 years old today but no-one seems inclined to celebrate:

My original #EldenRing character, now on Journey 3, is about to lap my second character in the race to get the final ending I'm missing: Ranni's ending. Character 2 is a spellblade, and I'm not feeling it, especially compared to my current spec of max Arc + dual curved swords with bleed.

#### [🔗 Why Conservatives Invented a ‘Right to Post’](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/12/legal-right-to-post-free-speech-social-media/672406/)

> Conservatives wanted the Hunter Biden story to derail the Biden campaign and pave the way for a Trump victory. They have now convinced themselves that it was somehow a constitutional violation for private companies not to take the bait, and that the state should force them to do so in the future.

> Before Musk purchased Twitter, conservatives had wanted to use the power of the state to control the platform. Once he purchased it, they assumed it would now become a reliable conduit for conservative propaganda. So they threatened to use the power of the state to force private companies to sustain Musk’s venture, and to silence activists exercising their First Amendment rights to register their objections. All in the name of “free speech.”

Felon Husk is right to warn you about Mastodon - it is a dangerous place full of dangerous people talking about dangerous things. Do NOT get an account on Mastodon. I warn you, it is very dangerous! Listen to Melon! Don't go there! People are talking about drugs, and sex, and rock and roll! Stay away if you value your safety!!!

I've had to skip two Advent of Code days in a row (days 16 and 17), because of social obligations. They do seem like interesting problems so I will try to solve them. According to the leaderboard finishing times they're also two of the hardests of this year, so far.

### 🤬 Dithering images has come full circle while still staying in the same place 

[🆆Dithering images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither) enjoyed a mild fad among people who are eager to create "lean" websites. Whether dithered images actually save space, and are thus less resource-intensive to display, is still an open question, but the ａｅｓｔｈｅｔｉｃ is there, which is the most important of course.

Enter [pixel-accurate Atkinson dithering](https://sheep.horse/2022/12/pixel_accurate_atkinson_dithering_for_images_in_ht.html) which deals with differing web page sizes by *dynamically re-dithering* the image on resize. 

We've come full circle. We're using computation to make sure our webpages look ugly at all sizes.

Back when Twelon tweeted out his "peace plan for Ukraine", people dunked on him for mentioning that Crimea should be retained by Russia, with "water rights ensured". This was singled out as a Kremlin talking point, which it no doubt is, but it's also a geographical fact that anyone who's done a little reading about the area and its history knows. I think Flusk included it primarily to seem smart and well-read, rather than blindly echoing Russian views.

### 🐦 Robert Farley: I am a realist

> I am a Realist, and as a Realist I think it's important to acknowledge that if we just gave Russia the permanent right to invade any of its neighbors anytime it sees fit then these disruptive wars would be unnecessary.

> As a Realist I feel this is a very realistic opinion.

> Also as a Realist it is important for me to point out that your moral outrage at Russia's tendency to invade its neighbors is entirely inappropriate.  My moral outrage about NATO expansion, however, is extremely Realistic and therefore appropriate.

> Also as a Realist I am obligated to point out that international organizations such as NATO are pointless and irrelevant and also the greatest possible threat to peace and stability in the history of human social interaction.  I know this because I am extremely Realistic.

> Finally, as a Realist I wish you would acknowledge that proxy war as a tool of statecraft is entirely without precedent in the history of international relations until it was invented by dastardly, unrealistic liberals in early 2022.
