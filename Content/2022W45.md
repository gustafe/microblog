Some big names following me on Mastodon, I am honored (ok I know it's because they're using a service to follow people from Twitter but it's still cool alright??)

For context I mostly write here and it's posted to my fedi account. You can get the whole experience directly (and faster!) using [one of the feeds](https://gerikson.com/m/subscribe.html).

Same dude who wanted Ukraine to give Russia everything it wanted is now saying parody isn't protected speech, and like insecure nerds everywhere, citing Wikipedia.

So if you pay for your $8/mo blue checkmark on Twitter, you're not allowed to change your handle at all on pains of suspension? I've never done it but changing your handle is a thing a lot of people do on Twitter to respond to current events, make jokes etc. If you're a paid user you get less functionality.

#### [David Golumbia: Fascism, Free Speech, and Musk’s Twitter][dgolumbia-twitter]

> When fascism talks about “free speech,” that has to be understood in the context of its fundamental commitment to “us” and “them.” Free speech, to the fascist, applies only to *us*. *We* must be allowed to say anything we want, without consequence. *We* get free speech, in the most ordinary sense of free speech. 

> When it comes to speech, this means that fascists often seem to think that fascists can say anything, and *non-fascists have to listen to them*.

> [...] Musk bought Twitter because he honestly believes that free speech means everyone else has to listen to and accept the torrents of racism and antisemitism his supporters have unleashed in celebration of his purchase of Twitter. We are less real than they are. We need to sit there and take it. That’s “free speech.”

Imagine if Google just reactivated Google+, sucked the air right out of Fedi... dump your Twitter backup into it and it would recreate your graph automagically. G+ had its good sides, the realnames crap was not it, but they'd be a credible alternative to Twitter now. 

%

The irony of HN complaining that the fediverse is "hard to use"... every bubble has its blind spots. I don't think the fediverse will absorb every Twitter refugee but the very fact it exists means that Fusk's walled garden is full of secret escape routes.

Kinda hit a wall in with my second Elden Ring character. Replaying the game reminds you that some bosses and dungeons aren't that fun, even with a new build. Also I'm stuck in the final bossfight with my first character's second journey and it's frustrating.

I just want to get the frenzied flame ending (1st character) and the Ranni ending (current character). Maybe time to take a break.

"Fusk considers putting Twitter behind a paywall" - man, the parallels to Freenode are just getting more and more apparent.

Got my work computer back after a defective screen fried it via USB-C and of course I now have to reinstall *everything*.

Elden Ring journey two complete, finally managed to beat the Beast (using Pest Threads, very effective) to become Lord of the Frenzied Flame. Next up: Ranni ending, then I should be 100%.

JFC Twitter really is Freenode II: The Fuckening. Every day brings new and hilarious details on how it's all going to shit. 

Today, 

> A lot of folks have asked about how you'll be able to distinguish between @TwitterBlue  subscribers with blue checkmarks and accounts that are verified as official, which is why we’re introducing the “Official" label to select accounts when we launch.

> Not all previously verified accounts will get the “Official” label and the label is not available for purchase. Accounts that will receive it include government accounts, commercial companies, business partners, major media outlets, publishers and some public figures.

> The new Twitter Blue does not include ID verification – it’s an opt-in, paid subscription that offers a blue checkmark and access to select features. We’ll continue to experiment with ways to differentiate between account types.

> __What happens next? It’s contagion time!__

> Alameda has likely been borrowing against the FTT it held — the FTT that is now crashing. (Earlier today, FTT was worth $19; as we post this, it’s trading at $4.60.)

> Binance might rescue FTX, but it’s sure not going to rescue Alameda.

> This means a series of margin calls by everyone who’s lent to Alameda. If Alameda defaults, those lenders will likely end up with worthless FTT.

### I don't know how much more comedy gold my blockchain can hold... 

So first off, the Twitter gray check thing they launched yesterday, to differentiate the *real* verified accounts from the soon to be scammy blue checks, was cancelled by Chairman Elon in a single reply tweet. Now the only way to see if a blue checkmark is really verified or simply paid for is to hover over it.

Then Binance, the biggest crypto exchange in the world, decided *not* to buy troubled <strike>next-biggest</strike> 3rd largest exchange FTX, leaving boy billionaire SBF high and dry and probably opening for further bloodbaths in crapto.

Third, the GOP didn't manage to swell more than a gentle ripple in the midterms and his sycophantic coverers are saying Former President Cheeto-dust is bigly mad at his awful candidates bombing, and the elders in the party are sharpening the long knives in favor of horrible ball of human lard DeSantis. May the civil war be long and bloody.

As usual, Matt Levine says it best:

> One other point here is that if this is the story, then it is not a *liquidity* crisis but a *solvency* one. That is, the problem is not a timing mismatch, in which FTX’s customers asked for their cash back but FTX did not have enough ready cash because it had long-term but money-good loans out. The problem is that FTX took its customers’ money and traded it for a pile of magic beans, and now the beans are worthless and there’s a huge hole in the balance sheet.

### 🎵 let it go, let it gooooo

A while back when I started this blog I downloaded my Twitter archive. It was too big to fit on my VPS so I plunked it onto the work computer. I did some fairly non-trivial Perl coding to extract my tweets (not replies or retweets) and massage them into the format here.

If you check the archive before Apr 2022 you'll see them. 

I didn't include images (I didn't post too many of them anyway). 

Anywhoo, that computer had to get its motherboard replaced so now that data and code is gone (thanks, TPM!). I *could* try to request a new archive but I think I'm too damn late with the current implosion. 

I think I'll just accept that I got the tweets out. [Remember Jaiku?](https://gerikson.com/m/2008/05/index.html#2008-05-28_tweets_05) Good times.

### 🐘The R-word, and replacements

People moving accounts from Twitter to the Fediverse (mostly Mastodon) have been semi-jokingly calling themselves "Twitter refugees". From a certain perspective, it seems to fit - you've arrived in a new "country" and aren't sure you'll fit in.

Plenty of people have pointed out that relatively privileged social media users describing themselves as refugees is insulting to *real* refugees, whose problems dwarf those of people losing their followers and likes.

A better term would be "mid-term school transfer" - there's still a giant support system around you, you just have to adjust to a new social circle.

Anyway, I had "refugee" in my pinned post but removed it in favor of "Twitter quiet quitter". I think the original concept of "quiet quitting"[1] was overblown and probably not real, but for this case it works. I still visit Twitter to see the car wreck from the front seats, but I don't interact as much as I did. I'm basically costing Twitter more than I give back and that's fine by me. 

---

[1] basically, in an American context , not going above and beyond the job description. At first I thought it was something like [work-to-rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work-to-rule), but more reading revealed it was employees not putting in unpaid overtime or working weekends. Capitalist propaganda, basically.

(The Wiki article does mention QQ as W2R but I reject that inclusion.)

#### [🔗🐘 JZW: Mastodon and Federation](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2022/11/mastodon-and-federation/)

> So what I think is going to happen is, the Twitter Diaspora is going to descend on Mastodon, and they're going to pick their instances essentially at random, for example through the time-tested technique of "the first one on the list that isn't currently closed for sign-ups". And then a few months later, the people actually running those instances are going to start flexing their muscle, and the users' response will be, "Wait, who even are you? This sucks. I just wanted my memes".<br/><br/>It's gonna go great!
