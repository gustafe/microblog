#### [🔗🚆 En Route: A Magazine About Trains in Japan {pdf}](https://www.tokyoweekender.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/En_Route_2023.pdf)

Is there a word for the sort of magazines you get in the front pocket of your seat when flying? Full of anodyne general interest content, heavily corporatized? This is one of these, but quite nice. 

Specifically the article about the train photographer Hirozaku Fukushima was a fun read. 

> For Fukushima, the transition from winter to spring — when the snow is gone but the trees are still bare and flowers have yet to bloom — is the “season that tests a photographer’s ability.”

I feel it.

(found on HN who are under the impression that trainspotters are a Japan-only phenomenon... oh man... )
