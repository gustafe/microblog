### AI rights and human rights

(Proposed reply to <https://lobste.rs/s/umicte/give_up_github#c_gsnu7v>)

Nearly all legal systems maintain a bright line between humans and other creatures. A severely disabled person, or someone in a coma, is arguably less conscious or capable than a trained chimpanzee, but they retain rights that the chimpanzee doesn't. I don't see any difference in the future between humans and artificial general intelligences. They will be treated as tools, or intellectual cattle, and the corporations that provide the infrastructure for them will retain complete control over their labor.

### The term "gilded age" is pejorative

I happened to listen to a podcast where someone remarked that a recent development was good, and we were living in a "gilded age" of said circumstance. However, the term is pejorative - it refers to the process of gilding, where a very thin layer of gold is placed on base metal, thus making it seem more valuable than it actually is. 

From [🆆el WP][wp-gilded-age-name]:

> The Gilded Age, the term for the period of economic boom which began after the American Civil War and ended at the turn of the century was applied to the era by historians in the 1920s, who took the term from one of Mark Twain's lesser-known novels, *The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today (1873)*. The book [...] satirized the promised "golden age" after the Civil War, portrayed as an era of serious social problems masked by a thin gold gilding of economic expansion.

Now you know.

### *Thor: Love and Thunder*

The kid and I saw this this evening. Not too bad, the Thor part of the MCU franchise has increasingly leaned into the more humorous area for a while. Helmsworth is excellent as the hunky god with the heart of gold. 

I did not recognize Christian Bale as the Big Bad (an excellent choice, btw), and definitely did not recognize Russel Crowe hilariously sending up his *Gladiator* persona as a chonky irascible Zeus. 

*Update* reading up on the backstory of [Gorr the God-Butcher][gorr], I find this hilarious (for Swedes) passage:

> The first symbiote, All-Black, is an ancient amorphous weapon originating from the evil Knull.

### *Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness*

Figured I'd catch up on this one. The Sam Raimi aesthetic (complete with obligatory Bruce Campbell cameo) is a refreshing twist on the candy-colored MCU, but the plot barely holds together. It's also funny to see how the MCU is slowly edging up against the parody phrase "the fate of this universe--and an infinity of other universes--is at stake!"

### Salt tax

I was aware of the [*gabelle* in France][gabelle], but did not know about the [salt tax in China][st-china] or in [British India][st-india]. 

I guess that salt is a popular commodity for taxation because it's essential for food preparation, relatively compact, and doesn't spoil. And the production areas are relatively easy to control. 

The *gabelle* in particular was crazy, and cited as a proximate cause of the Revolution.

> In 1773, along the Loire River, which separated the regions of Brittany and Anjou, with respective salt prices of 31 sous and 591 sous, over 3000 soldiers were stationed in response to the massive amounts of smuggling that took place.

### TIL: Chinese numerals

Wikipedia: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_numerals>

> There are two sets of characters for Chinese numerals: one for everyday writing, known as xiǎoxiě (traditional Chinese: 小寫; simplified Chinese: 小写; lit. 'small writing'), and one for use in commercial, accounting or financial contexts, known as dàxiě (traditional Chinese: 大寫; simplified Chinese: 大写; lit. 'big writing'). The latter arose because the characters used for writing numerals are geometrically simple, so simply using those numerals cannot prevent forgeries in the same way spelling numbers out in English would. A forger could easily change the everyday characters 三十 (30) to 五千 (5000) just by adding a few strokes. That would not be possible when writing using the financial characters 參拾 (30) and 伍仟 (5000).

### Wasted time()

In more places than I care to count in my Perl code, I've wanted to output the current time and/or date.

The way I've done it is by using the built-in function `localtime` (or its UTC variant `gmtime`). From the [manual][localtime-manual]:

> Converts a time as returned by the time function to a 9-element list with the time analyzed for the local time zone. Typically used as follows:

```
#     0    1    2     3     4    5     6     7     8
my ($sec,$min,$hour,$mday,$mon,$year,$wday,$yday,$isdst) =
                                            localtime(time);
```

So what I'd do, depending on what I'd want, was to copy the above definition into my code, then output (say) a ISO 8601 time like so:

```
printf("%04d-%02d-%02dT%02d:%02d:%02d\n", $year+1900, $mon+1, $mday, $hour, $min, $sec);
```

TEDIOUS

So what I found out *last month* was [`Time::Piece`][time-piece].

This provides an OO wrapper to `localtime` and friends, so the above code becomes 

```
my $t=localtime;
say $t->datetime;
```

And the kicker? It's been around since... 2001.

**CB**: Only it's all public, for technical reasons, so everyone can see what I do.  
**A**: Interesting.  
**CB**: So I need to use a mixing service, so the authorities can't track my totally legitimate transactions. But the authorities have placed the endpoints of the mixing service on the OFAC list so it can't be used anymore!  
**A**: Yes, we believe it was being used by bad people to launder money.  
**CB**: <strike>Laundering money</strike>Privacy is a human right!  
**A**: We don't agree on that but never mind.  
**CB**: You can't censor the output of decentralized anonymous smart contracts!  
**A**: Actually we just did.  
**CB**: Code has rights!  
**A**: Now you're just being silly. Anyway if it's just code, no-one's being harmed by it. It's one less way for criminals to launder money.  
**CB**: We'll just set up more mixers! You've unleashed a monster!  
**A**: Perhaps. But mixers rely on "innocent" transactions to conceal criminal traffic. If we block the contract outputs, no-one who is "innocent" will want to risk their funds in it. That's a win from our side, we think.

### Är SD Putins bandhundar?

Inte så att dom får rubler direkt i fickan från Kreml, men före Putins katastrofala invasion spelade dom helt klart på samma planhalva. EU-skepticism, allmän misstro mot demokratiska värderingar och split i svenska sammhället hjälpte Rysslands inflytande indirekt.

Men det är ledningen som gör detta. Sympatisörerna är nog mer misstrogna mot "ryssen", och sedan ryska soldater gått lös på ukrainska civila är det lätt att föreställa sig hur dess kära ömtåliga kvinnfolk skulle behandlas om Ryssland anföll. NATO-anslutningen kunde därför inte motstås utan att trovärdigt anklagas för att motverka Sveriges intressen. 

Om SD vinner inflytande så kommer dom mycket snart ifrågasätta varför svenska pensionärer ska frysa för Ukrainas skull. Men SD är inte längre en direktledning från Kreml till riksdagen. Detta är dock enbart Putins fel.

### CF boots KF

(for future readers: CF = Cloudflare, a DDoS protection and CDN provider, and KF = Kiwifarms, a forum dedicated to crowdsourced doxxing and harrassing people they enjoy harrassing)

Yesterday I went to bed sad that KF was still up, and today I woke up to find that Cloudflare had booted them. The world is a slightly better place.

%

### More on CF/Kiwifarms

This is not a "free speech" issue. None of the members of KF have had their right to speech infringed by the legal authorities. The site owner (formerly operating under the company name of "Final Solutions LLC") made the bet that hosting the worst people on the internet was financially sustainable. They used CF to achieve that goal. Other people used their right to expression to tell CF they were doing the wrong thing. CF finally agreed and KF is free to find another CDN provider on the open market. 

"Free speech" doesn't mean cheap speech. If you're saying something most people don't want to hear, don't expect it to be cheap and easy to say it.

*Update 2022-09-05:* KF moved to a new DDoS-protection provider (in Russia), which has now also booted them. Hilariously the owner is complaining Russia is not a "free country". Also referencing "the Cathedral", alt-right speak for everything that opposes them.

### Negativt för vem? 

Från SVT: [”För många hushåll är det ett förtvivlat läge”][svt-bostadspriser]

> Och många prognosmakare tror att priserna på bostäder kommer att fortsätta falla. Senast i raden är mäklarfirman Erik Olssons bostadsindex som visar att visningsbesökarna inte varit så __negativa__ vad gäller prisutvecklingen sedan 2011. Hela 67 procent av de tillfrågade i den undersökningen räknar med att priserna går ner under det kommande året.

(min fetstil)

Visningsbesökare är övervägande köpare. För säljare och mäklare är fallande priser negativt men för en köpare är det ju positivt - man får mer bostad för pengarna och chansen att man får ut mer pengar när man säljer ökar om man inte köper en bostad nära en pris-topp.

[russia-orthodoxy-nukes]: https://warontherocks.com/2019/06/blessed-be-thy-nuclear-weapons-the-rise-of-russian-nuclear-orthodoxy/

> Adamsky’s book covers two distinct but equally fascinating processes that have taken place in post-Soviet Russia: the church’s integration into the nuclear-military complex and the political system’s parallel quest to engineer a national idea, lend itself legitimacy, and rebuild the power of the state that crumbled when the Soviet Union collapsed. Russian Orthodoxy is thus a decidedly secular concept, a mechanical replacement part for the many bits of machinery – or in Russian parlance “political technology” – that broke during the nation’s failed attempt at democracy in the 1990s. The church, an institution with ambitions of its own, volunteered to participate in Russia’s time-honored tradition of restoring state power after collapse, and expanding it to dominate society. At its heart, Russian nuclear orthodoxy constitutes the collective belief that to preserve its Orthodox character, Russia must be a nuclear power, and to guarantee its nuclear status, Russia must be genuinely Orthodox.

> Friday was the 23rd of October [2009] and the Internet sceptics had a field day mocking one of their favourite punching bags James Ussher (1581 – 1656) Archbishop of Armagh. Ussher is notorious for dating the creation of the world to 6 pm on the 22nd of October 4004 BCE (and not 9 am on 23rd October as Pharyngula falsely stated) a fact that the hordes of Pharyngula and other similar self appointed defenders of scientism love to brandish as a proof of the stupidity of Christians.

> For various reasons Ussher chose the autumnal equinox and placed the moment of creation on the beginning of the Sunday preceding the 4004 BC equinox, 25th October, that he had determined using Kepler’s Rudolphine Tables. He chose the Sunday as the first day of creation because the Bible says that the creation took six days and God rested on the seventh, which is the Jewish Sabbath, the Saturday. The point of creation is 6pm on Saturday the 22nd October because in the Jewish calendar the new day starts at 6 pm. All of this is within the social and cultural norms of his times perfectly sensible and rational and only appears idiotic when viewed from our perspective. Ussher was not the fool that he is presented as being by the modern sceptics but a highly regarded scholar of his times.

### Meta note on timestamps

I have discovered once again that the timestamp scheme I came up with when I created feed support was not optimal (The design principle was "LOL YOLO"). So I've changed it and thus (probably) updated all entries in all feed readers. Sorry about that. I hope it won't happen again.

> Sacks is quietly becoming the leading practitioner of a new right-wing sensibility that has emerged in the political realignments provoked by Trumpism and the pandemic. On foreign policy, it offers a blend of isolationism, Trumpist nationalism, suspicion of the deep state, and the anti-empire realism of John Mearsheimer. Domestically, the vision is more muddled, a series of angry poses, a politics of pique, much of it playing out on Twitter, Callin, YouTube, Rumble, Substack, and other online media, especially among people who may have once counted themselves on the left but now can’t countenance the sight of homeless encampments.

### Ghost in the Shell thoughts

GitS was mentioned on lobste.rs. I'm maybe not a superfan of the franchise but I believe it stands head and shoulders over most other manga/anime fare. But that's because I really like material like *Patlabor* and *Planetes*.

I was late to GitS, I checked out the manga in English translation around 10 years ago from the awesome local library. I've watched both the "rebooted" movie and the original (better!) and the SAC series (great!). I've even tried to read the 1.5 manga, which sucks. 

If I'd discovered it during the 80s when cyberpunk was new and fresh... I dunno. I kinda like the technofetishist sidebars in the manga but if you've read you Gibson it's not really that new. It's weird to me how cyberpunk has become an aesthetic now. 

Anyway, GitS is fun in that Japanese way in that the main arc of SAC season 1 is basically just political corruption. There's no "take over the world" as in so much media now. Section 9 is a police unit (albeit vigilantic) and the show is a detective show.

Classic "trading memory for speed" implementation, Perl version:

> Perl implements lists with an array and first/last element offsets. The array is allocated larger than needed with the offsets originally pointing in the middle of the array so there is room to grow in both directions (unshifts and pushes/inserts) before a re-allocation of the underlying array is necessary. The consequence of this implementation is that all of perl's primitive list operators (insertion, fetching, determining array size, push, pop, shift, unshift, etc.) perform in O(1) time.

#### [The legacies of the Ottoman Empire](https://archive.ph/Qufoh)

> Darke’s laudatory comments, however, will be welcomed in some parts of contemporary Turkey, where nostalgia for the Ottomans extends not only to hit TV series but to mainstream political debate that frames the end of empire as a disaster orchestrated by malign forces from afar. There has been talk of appealing to a “neo-Ottomanism” in foreign policy as a means of restoring the prestige of Turkey and the Turks, but also as a counterbalance to the perceived shortcomings of US and western policy across the Middle East.

> This strikes a chord with the cocktail of nostalgia and imperialism that is being mixed in other quarters too, especially those that are heirs to crumbled empires. The most obvious parallel, of course, is Russia, where Vladimir Putin is the cheerleader of a chorus clamouring for the restoration of past glories and the re-incorporation of peoples who were once subject to the whims of rulers in faraway capitals. Something similar is afoot in Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s Turkey, where the Ottoman Empire is seen through the rosiest of tinted spectacles, as a benign entity that brought peace and harmony to all its citizens.

> When it comes to speech, this means that fascists often seem to think that fascists can say anything, and *non-fascists have to listen to them*.

> [...] Musk bought Twitter because he honestly believes that free speech means everyone else has to listen to and accept the torrents of racism and antisemitism his supporters have unleashed in celebration of his purchase of Twitter.

So first off, the Twitter gray check thing they launched yesterday, to differentiate the *real* verified accounts from the soon to be scammy blue checks, was cancelled by Chairman Elon in a single reply tweet. Now the only way to see if a blue checkmark is really verified or simply paid for is to hover over it.

Then Binance, the biggest crypto exchange in the world, decided *not* to buy troubled <strike>next-biggest</strike> 3rd largest exchange FTX, leaving boy billionaire SBF high and dry and probably opening for further bloodbaths in crapto.

Third, the GOP didn't manage to swell more than a gentle ripple in the midterms and his sycophantic coverers are saying Former President Cheeto-dust is bigly mad at his awful candidates bombing, and the elders in the party are sharpening the long knives in favor of horrible ball of human lard DeSantis.

The problem is that FTX took its customers’ money and traded it for a pile of magic beans, and now the beans are worthless and there’s a huge hole in the balance sheet.

### 🐘The R-word, and replacements

People moving accounts from Twitter to the Fediverse (mostly Mastodon) have been semi-jokingly calling themselves "Twitter refugees". From a certain perspective, it seems to fit - you've arrived in a new "country" and aren't sure you'll fit in.

Plenty of people have pointed out that relatively privileged social media users describing themselves as refugees is insulting to *real* refugees, whose problems dwarf those of people losing their followers and likes.

A better term would be "mid-term school transfer" - there's still a giant support system around you, you just have to adjust to a new social circle.

Anyway, I had "refugee" in my pinned post but removed it in favor of "Twitter quiet quitter". I think the original concept of "quiet quitting"[1] was overblown and probably not real, but for this case it works. I still visit Twitter to see the car wreck from the front seats, but I don't interact as much as I did. I'm basically costing Twitter more than I give back and that's fine by me.

[1] basically, in an American context , not going above and beyond the job description.

Hence Russian politicians and propagandists seek the power of Ukrainian resistance somewhere beyond Ukraine, or indeed beyond reality: in conspiracies of Nazis, Jews, gays, and Satanists.  In these fantasies, no one ever has to ask what Russia is or might be, what Russian culture might represent, since it is defined as opposition to a phantom.

<h3> 🇸🇪  Intressanta debattartiklar om somliga kyrkors syn på HBTQ-personer</h3>

Från min egen läsning har den evangeliska rörelsen i USA tappat en stor del av yngre människor bland annat genom behandlingen av HBTQ-personer. 

Från Arbetet.se.

[Tomas Hemstad: Joel Halldorf förstår inte skadan frikyrkorna gjort mot hbtq-samhället](https://arbetet.se/2022/11/15/joel-halldorf-forstar-inte-skadan-frikyrkorna-gjort-mot-hbtq-samhallet/)

> För några veckor sedan, på väg från en minneshögtid för en vän på vad som här poetiskt kallas Hibernia Beach, mitt i San Franciscos bögtäta Castro-område, stötte vi ihop med en trevlig ung man på en bar. <br/><br/>Han berättade att han i sena tonåren, efter att ha kommit ut, blivit avsläppt i San Francisco av sina mor- eller farföräldrar som varit hans trygghetssystem. “De är kristna”, lägger han till, och ingen vidare förklaring behövs. <br/><br/> Ibland heter det “de är katoliker” eller “de är evangelikala” men andemeningen är densamma: de accepterar mig inte, vill inte veta av mig om jag inte gör våld mot mig själv för att förändras.<br/><br/>Det är en så vanlig historia i USA att den knappt registrerar på sorglighetsskalan.

[Lina Landström i replik: "Tomas Hemstad förstår inte kyrkans roll i hbtq-personers liv"](https://arbetet.se/2022/11/16/tomas-hemstad-forstar-inte-kyrkans-roll-i-hbtq-personers-liv/)

> Liksom hbtq-communityt består av en salig blandning människor, så finns också en salig blandning kyrkor med olika teologier. Hemstad skriver: ”Frikyrkorna – pingströrelsen i allra högsta grad inkluderad – har gjort hbtq-samhället oerhörd skada över åren.” <br/><br/>Påståendet i sådant är inte osant, men det visar på Hemstads okunskap när det gäller vilka frikyrkorna är. Frikyrkorna inkluderar också Norrmalmskyrkan, idag en del av Equmeniakyrkan, som redan 1971 tog ställning för homosexuella. <br/><br/>När den moderna hbtq-rörelsen tog form i USA på 1970-talet stängdes de ute från alla samhällsinstanser, men då öppnade kyrkor dörrarna och lät hbtq-organisationerna få hålla sina möten i kyrkornas församlingslokaler.

### 🐘🐝 The buzz around Hive 

I'm not surprised the app Hive is getting traction among the masses fleeing Elmo's dumpster fire. It's slicker than fedi, there's *one* service to sign up for, not a plethora of instances with weird rules.[1]

And you know what? I think a commercialized service is what can absorb the flood right now. Especially if it's aligned with the values of Twitter (such as they are). There's an impedance mismatch between Twitter culture and Fedi culture that's going to be hard to overcome. A service that's prepared to monetize the traffic, pay for moderation, handle DMCA violation etc. is probably a better fit. 

Anywhoo I got an account there to squat my nick but I won't use the service.

[1] I know there are doubts if Hive is really on the up and up, see these threads

> Before Musk purchased Twitter, conservatives had wanted to use the power of the state to control the platform. Once he purchased it, they assumed it would now become a reliable conduit for conservative propaganda. So they threatened to use the power of the state to force private companies to sustain Musk’s venture, and to silence activists exercising their First Amendment rights to register their objections.
