### Austrian economics - a twitter thread by @davetroy

[Thread starts here](https://twitter.com/davetroy/status/1522725897706614785)

> Austrian Economics (gold, crypto) is rooted in a desire to make the world work in the way some people think it *should* work.

> The problem is‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt actually work that way, unless you are a sociopath. And even then, there are limits.

> Some examples‚Ä¶

> ‚ÄúPeople will move to where tax rates are cheaper,‚Äù they say. But most people don‚Äôt choose where they live based on tax rates. Sociopaths do, sometimes. Time after time this analysis never holds up, despite the alarming chatter. <https://t.co/HSjMRK1H40>

> The other big myth is that increasing the monetary supply *alone* contributes to inflation. In the current moment, we know that cartel influence over energy prices gives the oil+gas industry special leverage outside of monetary supply.

> Inflation doesn‚Äôt always directly correlate to increased monetary supply; and oil+gas cartels can ‚Äújuke the stats‚Äù to achieve whatever outcome they like. As usual, complex chaotic systems don‚Äôt lend themselves to reductive theses. Behavioral economics and complexity theory exist for a reason, to understand *actual* vs. surmised behavior. Why would proponents go to such lengths to disregard actual behavior and reality to impose their deductive (wrong) ideas about how money works on everyone? Because they think it will advantage them.

> It also enables various shady activities and Ponzi schemes; crypto is just playing back every financial scheme ever invented before regulators catch up. Tech often is a medium through which social misfits and miscreants reshape the world in ways that make them comfortable and fit in. Rather than try to adapt to a world they don‚Äôt understand, they wish to remake the world in a way that suits their view of it.

> We should all resist this. We definitely need to have big hairy messy conversations about money and its regulation. But reliance on poorly conceived and mostly wrong frameworks that make sense primarily to teen boys and sociopaths, and has no bearing on data, human behavior, or reality, is not the way. It‚Äôs time to discard this bad hand and move on.

### Rasmus Paludan and "free speech"

Rasmus Paludan is a craven little shitweasel and I hope he meets the fate he deserves as soon as possible.

[@ChrChristensen thread](https://twitter.com/ChrChristensen/status/1525043012694327296?s=20)

> Danish far-right "activist" Rasmus Paludan burnt 3 Qur'ans in Sweden yesterday. There's a tendency to claim that people who criticize these acts are "against free speech." That's not only intellectually juvenile, but shows a lack of understanding about how free speech works.

> Critiquing the MANNER in which free speech is exercised isn't the same thing as saying the right should be revoked or speech banned. For example, I was opposed to the US occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan. I was also opposed to any bans on protesting against these occupations.

> But, if anti-war protesters staged a protest at the funeral of a soldier killed in the war with signs saying the solder deserved to die, I'd critique both the MANNER and CONTENT of their speech. That doesn't mean I'd ban either their right to gather or their right to speak.

> Citizens exercising their free speech rights to question how others have exercised their free speech rights is actually the perfect crystallization of free speech and democratic engagement in action. To suggest hard critique of speech stifles free speech is counterintuitive.

> When Paludan wraps his Islamophobia in "free speech," don't be surprised if others exercise their rights to then call out what they consider a transparent attack on a religious group. Labeling those who do so as "anti-free speech" is, ironically, an attempt to stifle speech.

> Journalists, politicians, pundits forever whine about behavior that's perfectly legal, but they consider anti-social. The message? Just because you have the right to do something doesn't mean it's the right/responsible/democratic decision. Precisely what critics tell Paludan.

> It's amusing to see opinion leaders who spend a huge amount of time telling citizens about the "correct" and "incorrect" way to exercise their freedoms -- like, say, telling Muslim women what they should wear -- suddenly wetting their pants when Qur'an-burners are criticized.

> What this comes down to is how framing of freedoms/rights varies dramatically depending on whose rights are discussed. Paludan? Then it's the letter of the law that matters. Immigrants? Well, then we begin to critique based on things like "values." Legal rights less important.

### [HTML Only](https://lobste.rs/s/s4jsru/html_only)

Interesting submission about a super simple way to blog. 

I must say I'm pleasantly surprised how fast this blog setup is. All data (basically most tweets since 2007 plus stuff I've written since the end of April) is 1.8MB of text in fortune format, and takes under 3s to render to HTML from Markdown.

Anyway, people should do whatever. I've long held the opinion that manually writing HTML/XML (closing tags etc) is a huge pain, and the advent of Markdown was a sweet release from that pain. For some unfathomable reason static site generators have ballooned in complexity. If you just want a frikkin' site, MD + some perl has you covered.

### systemd.path vs make

I used to build this blog on demand using a simple make recipe, but I've long wanted to move it to being built if a file is changed. 

Inspired by [this post](https://me.rbel.co/posts/lists-sh-hacks/)[1], I managed to get it going, with some trial and error. 

Specifically, in addition to running the command 

    systemctl --user enable microblog.{path,service}

I also had to run 
	
    systemctl --user start microblog.path 

The entire process (9.8k entries) takes around 3s. I'm pondering "optimizing" it but don't know if it's worth it.

[1] that post pertains to <https://lists.sh>, which is an interesting service if you're into list-based microblogging.

### A month of microblogging

It's been a month since I whipped up this blog and started using it as a sort of replacement for Twitter and Mastodon.

So far, so good. I'm enjoying being able to structure my posts however I want, using Markdown + HTML, and the freedom of being able to post everything from a single line to an entire essay is liberating.

What's missing is a solution where I don't have to edit the content using a text editor. Some sort of web-based interface, so I can use it from a mobile too.

The situation in Ukraine remains terrible, with continued shelling and rampant human rights abuses, but at least the IANA TZ database has changed the timezone name from Kiev to Kyiv.

Some background: the TZ Info mailing list has had regular messages from Ukrainian activists requesting the change of the timezone Europe/Kiev to Europe/Kyiv. They've referred to Ukrainian law, and in at least one case threatened with criminal prosecution.

The maintainers have consistently replied that they're following the common transliteration used in English-language media, and have also noted that the names within the tzinfo files are to be seen as abstract labels only - applications are supposed to provide correct localizations on top of them.

Now, however, enough English-language media are using Kyiv that the change will be happening soon.

*Update, Fri 01 July 2022:* I was wrong, the sparks are still flying in the mailing list.

### Love, Death and Robots SE03

I can broadly agree with [this article][lgm] and associated 
[Twitter thread][twitter]. LD&R season 3 is not breaking any new ground, and the trend towards horror isn't something that I really like, personally. 

I'd note that two episodes are based on stories by Neal Asher, whom I happen to appreciate for his British nihilism, but they are very gory and masculine.

Having two episodes where US Special Forces encounter a monster and are slaughtered is one too many, even if one of them is played for laughs. 

On the other hand, it's not really LD&R's job to showcase short SF. It's more a showcase for innovative animation, and SF tropes are a good scaffolding to hang that on.

I'd really love Netflix to showcase more "low-key" stories, that might be more well-served by more traditional episode lengths and live action.

#### \#Swedengate

This is the dumbest thing ever to blow up.

To be fair, this hasn't happened to me as a prospective *guest*, but we've hosted friends of kids many times, and each time we've asked kid or parent whether it's ok if they want to eat dinner. It's common courtesy, if nothing else it prevents unneeded work for the other household.

If everyone is ok with it, we serve food. Simple as that.

People are reaching deep back into so-called history, as if the only way Swedes have from going berserk and killing each other is denying food to kids. This makes very little sense, because in most other social interactions, there's not a big difference between Swedes and other nationalities when it comes to buying dinner, drinks &c. So why is "feeding someone else's child" a special, atavistic remnant from the Viking age? 

To me this sounds more like a viral eruption of the US political factions' love/hate relationship with Sweden.

*Update* this [thread][hanna-friden-swedengate] by Hanna Frid√©n nails it:

> All the theories trying to explain, in a nice way, why kids sometimes weren't offered dinner in Sweden are WILD.

> The people who say that this only happened to them when they were visiting upper-middle and upper class-households though, they are on the correct track.

#### More wonderful "natural, human scale" measurements

[üÜÜBritish thermal unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_thermal_unit):

> The __British thermal unit__ (__BTU__ or __Btu__) is a unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. [...] The modern SI unit for heat and energy is the joule (J); one BTU equals about 1055&nbsp;J (varying within the range 1054‚Äì1060&nbsp;J depending on the specific definition [...])

Mainly Canadian definition, eh:

> 60 ¬∞F (15.6 ¬∞C) | ‚âà1,054.68&nbsp;J | Mainly Canadian.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

NO CONFUSION, VERY LOGICAL:

> The unit __Mbtu__ is used in natural gas and other industries to indicate 1,000 BTUs. However, there is an ambiguity in that the metric system (SI) uses the prefix "M" to indicate one million (1,000,000). Even so, "MMbtu" is often used to indicate one million BTUs particularly in the oil and gas industry.

Totally normal island:

> The Btu should not be confused with the Board of Trade Unit (BTU), an obsolete UK synonym for kilowatt hour (1 kW‚ãÖh or 3,412 Btu).

> How did it happen? Well, in 1917 the Russian Empire was close to winning the WWI and getting the immense territorial gains. It would fulfil it's ancient dream of capturing the Istanbul, establishing dominance in Balkans and in Slavic Central Europe. The West wouldn't allow that

> [...]

I was wondering what was preventing some rich asshole / troll from "buying up" all the available slots, but this is supposed to mitigated by a sort of hashcash like functionality. Public keys have to conform to a specific format, and they are intentionally limited in time (last 4 digits are the valid year, +/- a couple of years.

Items aren't stored forever, they're removed from the store after 28 days of inactivity. 

As the number of items nears the hard limit of 10M, the "difficulty" to add another item increases. 

The servers are organized into "realms", and each realm can have its own rules for how to implement spam prevention, moderation/"censorship", etc. So there's probably going to be strictly more than 10M items, as realms can diverge in what items they will keep.

[Itmechr3-tweet]: https://twitter.com/Itmechr3/statuses/1539659570343071744

If you ask people about the Terror nowadays they'd say that aristocrats and royals were the main victims. This is of course the result of long propaganda by reactionaries who were outraged that these people were even considered targets for state-sponsored terror. The brutal suppression of the Vend√©e is something they'd approve of were it performed by the *ancien r√©gime*. 

The Terror was an affront to *human rights* but reactionaries are still pissed a tiny number of elites were included among its victims.

*Update:* next time you visit Sacr√©-C≈ìur on Montmartre, remember it was built to "atone" for the *soi-disant* crimes of the Paris Commune.

### Feed housekeeping

I've made some changes that hopefully makes the (Atom) feed a bit nicer to use.

Titles are now "Entry X on YYYY-mm-DD", instead of using the internal ID. 

The publication dates have never been "real", as [I don't really have metadata][limits-of-metadata]. Instead I've faked the hour/minute/second based on the date. But that meant that edits don't really trigger a new timestamp. I've started to set the minute as: 

    (last hex digit of the MD5 digest of the entry) % 60

This should generate a new "timestamp" when the post is edited.

### Opting out from feeding machine learning

There's a lot of naive fascination with content generation via machine learning in nerd circles right now. Tools like GPT-3 and DALL-E are hailed as innovations, letting people create "content" using just a text box entry.

Others are rightly worried what will happen when gigabytes of vaguely convincing text and images can be created at will, avoiding the uncanny valley of machine-generated dross that's been the norm up until now.

It doesn't have to be this way. Any content creator should be able to mark their creations as off-limits as a source of data for these models. It probably won't stop them, and it might not even be very effective, but it will raise the issue: these models are *nothing* without human input. And humans should be able to decide whether they're going to help machines put them out of work, and to help destroy democracy by poisoning social media even more.

Nearly all legal systems maintain a bright line between humans and other creatures. A severely disabled person, or someone in a coma, is arguably less conscious or capable than a trained chimpanzee, but they retain rights that the chimpanzee doesn't. I don't see any difference in the future between humans and artificial general intelligences. They will be treated as tools, or intellectual cattle, and the corporations that provide the infrastructure for them will retain complete control over their labor.

### The term "gilded age" is pejorative

I happened to listen to a podcast where someone remarked that a recent development was good, and we were living in a "gilded age" of said circumstance. However, the term is pejorative - it refers to the process of gilding, where a very thin layer of gold is placed on base metal, thus making it seem more valuable than it actually is. 

From [üÜÜel WP][wp-gilded-age-name]:

> The Gilded Age, the term for the period of economic boom which began after the American Civil War and ended at the turn of the century was applied to the era by historians in the 1920s, who took the term from one of Mark Twain's lesser-known novels, *The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today (1873)*. The book [...] satirized the promised "golden age" after the Civil War, portrayed as an era of serious social problems masked by a thin gold gilding of economic expansion.

I was aware of the [*gabelle* in France][gabelle], but did not know about the [salt tax in China][st-china] or in [British India][st-india]. 

I guess that salt is a popular commodity for taxation because it's essential for food preparation, relatively compact, and doesn't spoil. And the production areas are relatively easy to control. 

The *gabelle* in particular was crazy, and cited as a proximate cause of the Revolution.

> In 1773, along the Loire River, which separated the regions of Brittany and Anjou, with respective salt prices of 31 sous and 591 sous, over 3000 soldiers were stationed in response to the massive amounts of smuggling that took place.

### TIL: Chinese numerals

Wikipedia: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_numerals>

> There are two sets of characters for Chinese numerals: one for everyday writing, known as xi«éoxiƒõ (traditional Chinese: Â∞èÂØ´; simplified Chinese: Â∞èÂÜô; lit. 'small writing'), and one for use in commercial, accounting or financial contexts, known as d√†xiƒõ (traditional Chinese: Â§ßÂØ´; simplified Chinese: Â§ßÂÜô; lit. 'big writing'). The latter arose because the characters used for writing numerals are geometrically simple, so simply using those numerals cannot prevent forgeries in the same way spelling numbers out in English would. A forger could easily change the everyday characters ‰∏âÂçÅ (30) to ‰∫îÂçÉ (5000) just by adding a few strokes. That would not be possible when writing using the financial characters ÂèÉÊãæ (30) and ‰ºç‰ªü (5000).

### Wasted time()

In more places than I care to count in my Perl code, I've wanted to output the current time and/or date.

The way I've done it is by using the built-in function `localtime` (or its UTC variant `gmtime`). From the [manual][localtime-manual]:

> Converts a time as returned by the time function to a 9-element list with the time analyzed for the local time zone. Typically used as follows:

```
#     0    1    2     3     4    5     6     7     8
my ($sec,$min,$hour,$mday,$mon,$year,$wday,$yday,$isdst) =
                                            localtime(time);
```

So what I'd do, depending on what I'd want, was to copy the above definition into my code, then output (say) a ISO 8601 time like so:

```
printf("%04d-%02d-%02dT%02d:%02d:%02d\n", $year+1900, $mon+1, $mday, $hour, $min, $sec);
```

TEDIOUS

So what I found out *last month* was [`Time::Piece`][time-piece].

This provides an OO wrapper to `localtime` and friends, so the above code becomes 

```
my $t=localtime;
say $t->datetime;
```

And the kicker? It's been around since... 2001.

> Linux-tinged hatred of Microsoft is a meme in the original sense - I‚Äôm surprised seeing nerds a generation younger than me essentially repeating the same tropes people I knew did in the late 90s. [...]

One difference is that I don't remember Linux boosters being quite so right-libertarian back in the day. Lunduke himself is rabidly anti-abortion, for example.

> Coding as 11 purportedly independent developers, Ian [Macalinao], a 20-something computer wiz from Texas, created a vast web of interlocking DeFi protocols that projected billions of dollars of double-counted value onto the Saber ecosystem. That temporarily inflated the total value locked (TVL) on Solana, as the network was racing toward its zenith last November. The DeFi faithful regard TVL as a barometer for on-chain activity.

### A dialog

**Crypto Bro**: I'm using cryptocurrency, it enables me to make transactions that can't be stopped by the authorities!  
**Authorities**: OK  
**CB**: Only it's all public, for technical reasons, so everyone can see what I do.  
**A**: Interesting.  
**CB**: So I need to use a mixing service, so the authorities can't track my totally legitimate transactions. But the authorities have placed the endpoints of the mixing service on the OFAC list so it can't be used anymore!  
**A**: Yes, we believe it was being used by bad people to launder money.  
**CB**: <strike>Laundering money</strike>Privacy is a human right!  
**A**: We don't agree on that but never mind.  
**CB**: You can't censor the output of decentralized anonymous smart contracts!  
**A**: Actually we just did.  
**CB**: Code has rights!  
**A**: Now you're just being silly. Anyway if it's just code, no-one's being harmed by it. It's one less way for criminals to launder money.  
**CB**: We'll just set up more mixers! You've unleashed a monster!  
**A**: Perhaps. But mixers rely on "innocent" transactions to conceal criminal traffic. If we block the contract outputs, no-one who is "innocent" will want to risk their funds in it. That's a win from our side, we think.  
**CB**: *incoherent sputtering*

[Nicholas Weaver has more](https://twitter.com/ncweaver/status/1559527533099433986):

> They happened to release their code as open source, and the instance of the program is running on a zombie basis, but nothing about the sanction was sanctioning "code".

> The sanction was "Tornado Cash the organization" and "These running instances of the money laundormat"

> And it really was "profit from" too.

> The "TORN" token was an unregistered security that paid the insiders.  The mixer claims 1% withdraw fees for any withdraw using a relayer to fund the gas fees.  So for laundering $1B, that is $10M to the organization.

### √Ñr SD Putins bandhundar?

Inte s√• att dom f√•r rubler direkt i fickan fr√•n Kreml, men f√∂re Putins katastrofala invasion spelade dom helt klart p√• samma planhalva. EU-skepticism, allm√§n misstro mot demokratiska v√§rderingar och split i svenska sammh√§llet hj√§lpte Rysslands inflytande indirekt.

Men det √§r ledningen som g√∂r detta. Sympatis√∂rerna √§r nog mer misstrogna mot "ryssen", och sedan ryska soldater g√•tt l√∂s p√• ukrainska civila √§r det l√§tt att f√∂rest√§lla sig hur dess k√§ra √∂mt√•liga kvinnfolk skulle behandlas om Ryssland anf√∂ll. NATO-anslutningen kunde d√§rf√∂r inte motst√•s utan att trov√§rdigt anklagas f√∂r att motverka Sveriges intressen. 

Om SD vinner inflytande s√• kommer dom mycket snart ifr√•gas√§tta varf√∂r svenska pension√§rer ska frysa f√∂r Ukrainas skull. Men SD √§r inte l√§ngre en direktledning fr√•n Kreml till riksdagen. Detta √§r dock enbart Putins fel.

### CF boots KF

(for future readers: CF = Cloudflare, a DDoS protection and CDN provider, and KF = Kiwifarms, a forum dedicated to crowdsourced doxxing and harrassing people they enjoy harrassing)

Yesterday I went to bed sad that KF was still up, and today I woke up to find that Cloudflare had booted them. The world is a slightly better place.

%

### More on CF/Kiwifarms

This is not a "free speech" issue. None of the members of KF have had their right to speech infringed by the legal authorities. The site owner (formerly operating under the company name of "Final Solutions LLC") made the bet that hosting the worst people on the internet was financially sustainable. They used CF to achieve that goal. Other people used their right to expression to tell CF they were doing the wrong thing. CF finally agreed and KF is free to find another CDN provider on the open market. 

"Free speech" doesn't mean cheap speech. If you're saying something most people don't want to hear, don't expect it to be cheap and easy to say it.

*Update 2022-09-05:* KF moved to a new DDoS-protection provider (in Russia), which has now also booted them. Hilariously the owner is complaining Russia is not a "free country". Also referencing "the Cathedral", alt-right speak for everything that opposes them.

[russia-orthodoxy-nukes]: https://warontherocks.com/2019/06/blessed-be-thy-nuclear-weapons-the-rise-of-russian-nuclear-orthodoxy/

> Adamsky‚Äôs book covers two distinct but equally fascinating processes that have taken place in post-Soviet Russia: the church‚Äôs integration into the nuclear-military complex and the political system‚Äôs parallel quest to engineer a national idea, lend itself legitimacy, and rebuild the power of the state that crumbled when the Soviet Union collapsed. Russian Orthodoxy is thus a decidedly secular concept, a mechanical replacement part for the many bits of machinery ‚Äì or in Russian parlance ‚Äúpolitical technology‚Äù ‚Äì that broke during the nation‚Äôs failed attempt at democracy in the 1990s. The church, an institution with ambitions of its own, volunteered to participate in Russia‚Äôs time-honored tradition of restoring state power after collapse, and expanding it to dominate society. At its heart, Russian nuclear orthodoxy constitutes the collective belief that to preserve its Orthodox character, Russia must be a nuclear power, and to guarantee its nuclear status, Russia must be genuinely Orthodox.

[christy-ussher]: https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2009/10/25/in-defence-of-the-indefensible/

> Friday was the 23rd of October [2009] and the Internet sceptics had a field day mocking one of their favourite punching bags James Ussher (1581 ‚Äì 1656) Archbishop of Armagh. Ussher is notorious for dating the creation of the world to 6 pm on the 22nd of October 4004 BCE (and not 9 am on 23rd October as Pharyngula falsely stated) a fact that the hordes of Pharyngula and other similar self appointed defenders of scientism love to brandish as a proof of the stupidity of Christians.

> For various reasons Ussher chose the autumnal equinox and placed the moment of creation on the beginning of the Sunday preceding the 4004 BC equinox, 25th October, that he had determined using Kepler‚Äôs Rudolphine Tables. He chose the Sunday as the first day of creation because the Bible says that the creation took six days and God rested on the seventh, which is the Jewish Sabbath, the Saturday. The point of creation is 6pm on Saturday the 22nd October because in the Jewish calendar the new day starts at 6 pm. All of this is within the social and cultural norms of his times perfectly sensible and rational and only appears idiotic when viewed from our perspective. Ussher was not the fool that he is presented as being by the modern sceptics but a highly regarded scholar of his times.

> Sacks is quietly becoming the leading practitioner of a new right-wing sensibility that has emerged in the political realignments provoked by Trumpism and the pandemic. On foreign policy, it offers a blend of isolationism, Trumpist nationalism, suspicion of the deep state, and the anti-empire realism of John Mearsheimer.

### Ghost in the Shell thoughts

GitS was mentioned on lobste.rs. I'm maybe not a superfan of the franchise but I believe it stands head and shoulders over most other manga/anime fare. But that's because I really like material like *Patlabor* and *Planetes*.

I was late to GitS, I checked out the manga in English translation around 10 years ago from the awesome local library. I've watched both the "rebooted" movie and the original (better!) and the SAC series (great!). I've even tried to read the 1.5 manga, which sucks. 

If I'd discovered it during the 80s when cyberpunk was new and fresh... I dunno. I kinda like the technofetishist sidebars in the manga but if you've read you Gibson it's not really that new. It's weird to me how cyberpunk has become an aesthetic now. 

Anyway, GitS is fun in that Japanese way in that the main arc of SAC season 1 is basically just political corruption. There's no "take over the world" as in so much media now. Section 9 is a police unit (albeit vigilantic) and the show is a detective show.

Classic "trading memory for speed" implementation, Perl version:

> Perl implements lists with an array and first/last element offsets. The array is allocated larger than needed with the offsets originally pointing in the middle of the array so there is room to grow in both directions (unshifts and pushes/inserts) before a re-allocation of the underlying array is necessary. The consequence of this implementation is that all of perl's primitive list operators (insertion, fetching, determining array size, push, pop, shift, unshift, etc.) perform in O(1) time.

#### [The legacies of the Ottoman Empire](https://archive.ph/Qufoh)

> Darke‚Äôs laudatory comments, however, will be welcomed in some parts of contemporary Turkey, where nostalgia for the Ottomans extends not only to hit TV series but to mainstream political debate that frames the end of empire as a disaster orchestrated by malign forces from afar. There has been talk of appealing to a ‚Äúneo-Ottomanism‚Äù in foreign policy as a means of restoring the prestige of Turkey and the Turks, but also as a counterbalance to the perceived shortcomings of US and western policy across the Middle East.

> This strikes a chord with the cocktail of nostalgia and imperialism that is being mixed in other quarters too, especially those that are heirs to crumbled empires. The most obvious parallel, of course, is Russia, where Vladimir Putin is the cheerleader of a chorus clamouring for the restoration of past glories and the re-incorporation of peoples who were once subject to the whims of rulers in faraway capitals. Something similar is afoot in Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan‚Äôs Turkey, where the Ottoman Empire is seen through the rosiest of tinted spectacles, as a benign entity that brought peace and harmony to all its citizens.

### I don't know how much more comedy gold my blockchain can hold... 

So first off, the Twitter gray check thing they launched yesterday, to differentiate the *real* verified accounts from the soon to be scammy blue checks, was cancelled by Chairman Elon in a single reply tweet. Now the only way to see if a blue checkmark is really verified or simply paid for is to hover over it.

Then Binance, the biggest crypto exchange in the world, decided *not* to buy troubled <strike>next-biggest</strike> 3rd largest exchange FTX, leaving boy billionaire SBF high and dry and probably opening for further bloodbaths in crapto.

A while back when I started this blog I downloaded my Twitter archive. It was too big to fit on my VPS so I plunked it onto the work computer. I did some fairly non-trivial Perl coding to extract my tweets (not replies or retweets) and massage them into the format here.

Anywhoo, that computer had to get its motherboard replaced so now that data and code is gone (thanks, TPM!). I *could* try to request a new archive but I think I'm too damn late with the current implosion.

### üêòThe R-word, and replacements

People moving accounts from Twitter to the Fediverse (mostly Mastodon) have been semi-jokingly calling themselves "Twitter refugees". From a certain perspective, it seems to fit - you've arrived in a new "country" and aren't sure you'll fit in.

Plenty of people have pointed out that relatively privileged social media users describing themselves as refugees is insulting to *real* refugees, whose problems dwarf those of people losing their followers and likes.

A better term would be "mid-term school transfer" - there's still a giant support system around you, you just have to adjust to a new social circle.

Anyway, I had "refugee" in my pinned post but removed it in favor of "Twitter quiet quitter". I think the original concept of "quiet quitting"[1] was overblown and probably not real, but for this case it works. I still visit Twitter to see the car wreck from the front seats, but I don't interact as much as I did. I'm basically costing Twitter more than I give back and that's fine by me.

[1] basically, in an American context , not going above and beyond the job description. At first I thought it was something like [üÜÜwork-to-rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work-to-rule), but more reading revealed it was employees not putting in unpaid overtime or working weekends. Capitalist propaganda, basically.

> So what I think is going to happen is, the Twitter Diaspora is going to descend on Mastodon, and they're going to pick their instances essentially at random, for example through the time-tested technique of "the first one on the list that isn't currently closed for sign-ups". And then a few months later, the people actually running those instances are going to start flexing their muscle, and the users' response will be, "Wait, who even are you? This sucks. I just wanted my memes".<br/><br/>It's gonna go great!

> [...] it is hard for Russians in mass media to explain Ukrainian resistance.  They lack any concept of a self-aware people.  They see themselves as the clever winners and the Russian people as manipulable fools.  They cannot imagine defending the moral nation with their physical bodies, and so cannot attribute such a motive to the Ukrainians.  Hence Russian politicians and propagandists seek the power of Ukrainian resistance somewhere beyond Ukraine, or indeed beyond reality: in conspiracies of Nazis, Jews, gays, and Satanists.  In these fantasies, no one ever has to ask what Russia is or might be, what Russian culture might represent, since it is defined as opposition to a phantom.

<h3> üá∏üá™  Intressanta debattartiklar om somliga kyrkors syn p√• HBTQ-personer</h3>

Fr√•n min egen l√§sning har den evangeliska r√∂relsen i USA tappat en stor del av yngre m√§nniskor bland annat genom behandlingen av HBTQ-personer. 

Fr√•n Arbetet.se.

[Tomas Hemstad: Joel Halldorf f√∂rst√•r inte skadan frikyrkorna gjort mot hbtq-samh√§llet](https://arbetet.se/2022/11/15/joel-halldorf-forstar-inte-skadan-frikyrkorna-gjort-mot-hbtq-samhallet/)

> F√∂r n√•gra veckor sedan, p√• v√§g fr√•n en minnesh√∂gtid f√∂r en v√§n p√• vad som h√§r poetiskt kallas Hibernia Beach, mitt i San Franciscos b√∂gt√§ta Castro-omr√•de, st√∂tte vi ihop med en trevlig ung man p√• en bar. <br/><br/>Han ber√§ttade att han i sena ton√•ren, efter att ha kommit ut, blivit avsl√§ppt i San Francisco av sina mor- eller farf√∂r√§ldrar som varit hans trygghetssystem. ‚ÄúDe √§r kristna‚Äù, l√§gger han till, och ingen vidare f√∂rklaring beh√∂vs. <br/><br/> Ibland heter det ‚Äúde √§r katoliker‚Äù eller ‚Äúde √§r evangelikala‚Äù men andemeningen √§r densamma: de accepterar mig inte, vill inte veta av mig om jag inte g√∂r v√•ld mot mig sj√§lv f√∂r att f√∂r√§ndras.<br/><br/>Det √§r en s√• vanlig historia i USA att den knappt registrerar p√• sorglighetsskalan.

> Liksom hbtq-communityt best√•r av en salig blandning m√§nniskor, s√• finns ocks√• en salig blandning kyrkor med olika teologier. Hemstad skriver: ‚ÄùFrikyrkorna ‚Äì pingstr√∂relsen i allra h√∂gsta grad inkluderad ‚Äì har gjort hbtq-samh√§llet oerh√∂rd skada √∂ver √•ren.‚Äù <br/><br/>P√•st√•endet i s√•dant √§r inte osant, men det visar p√• Hemstads okunskap n√§r det g√§ller vilka frikyrkorna √§r. Frikyrkorna inkluderar ocks√• Norrmalmskyrkan, idag en del av Equmeniakyrkan, som redan 1971 tog st√§llning f√∂r homosexuella. <br/><br/>N√§r den moderna hbtq-r√∂relsen tog form i USA p√• 1970-talet st√§ngdes de ute fr√•n alla samh√§llsinstanser, men d√• √∂ppnade kyrkor d√∂rrarna och l√§t hbtq-organisationerna f√• h√•lla sina m√∂ten i kyrkornas f√∂rsamlingslokaler.

### üêòüêù The buzz around Hive 

I'm not surprised the app Hive is getting traction among the masses fleeing Elmo's dumpster fire. It's slicker than fedi, there's *one* service to sign up for, not a plethora of instances with weird rules.[1]

And you know what? I think a commercialized service is what can absorb the flood right now. Especially if it's aligned with the values of Twitter (such as they are). There's an impedance mismatch between Twitter culture and Fedi culture that's going to be hard to overcome. A service that's prepared to monetize the traffic, pay for moderation, handle DMCA violation etc. is probably a better fit. 

Anywhoo I got an account there to squat my nick but I won't use the service.

Other countries: our independence was won during the warmer months when people had the energy to gather in mobs. 

Finland: our independence was won in the depths of Winter, wrested from the cold hands of a dying Empire.

Another country that counts its independence from 6 Dec is the Republic of Ireland, 100 years old today but no-one seems inclined to celebrate:

My original #EldenRing character, now on Journey 3, is about to lap my second character in the race to get the final ending I'm missing: Ranni's ending. Character 2 is a spellblade, and I'm not feeling it, especially compared to my current spec of max Arc + dual curved swords with bleed.

> Conservatives wanted the Hunter Biden story to derail the Biden campaign and pave the way for a Trump victory. They have now convinced themselves that it was somehow a constitutional violation for private companies not to take the bait, and that the state should force them to do so in the future.

> Before Musk purchased Twitter, conservatives had wanted to use the power of the state to control the platform. Once he purchased it, they assumed it would now become a reliable conduit for conservative propaganda. So they threatened to use the power of the state to force private companies to sustain Musk‚Äôs venture, and to silence activists exercising their First Amendment rights to register their objections. All in the name of ‚Äúfree speech.‚Äù

### ü§¨ Dithering images has come full circle while still staying in the same place 

[üÜÜDithering images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither) enjoyed a mild fad among people who are eager to create "lean" websites. Whether dithered images actually save space, and are thus less resource-intensive to display, is still an open question, but the ÔΩÅÔΩÖÔΩìÔΩîÔΩàÔΩÖÔΩîÔΩâÔΩÉ is there, which is the most important of course.

Enter [pixel-accurate Atkinson dithering](https://sheep.horse/2022/12/pixel_accurate_atkinson_dithering_for_images_in_ht.html) which deals with differing web page sizes by *dynamically re-dithering* the image on resize. 

We've come full circle. We're using computation to make sure our webpages look ugly at all sizes.

Back when Twelon tweeted out his "peace plan for Ukraine", people dunked on him for mentioning that Crimea should be retained by Russia, with "water rights ensured". This was singled out as a Kremlin talking point, which it no doubt is, but it's also a geographical fact that anyone who's done a little reading about the area and its history knows. I think Flusk included it primarily to seem smart and well-read, rather than blindly echoing Russian views.

### üê¶ Robert Farley: I am a realist

> I am a Realist, and as a Realist I think it's important to acknowledge that if we just gave Russia the permanent right to invade any of its neighbors anytime it sees fit then these disruptive wars would be unnecessary.

> As a Realist I feel this is a very realistic opinion.

> Also as a Realist it is important for me to point out that your moral outrage at Russia's tendency to invade its neighbors is entirely inappropriate.  My moral outrage about NATO expansion, however, is extremely Realistic and therefore appropriate.

> Also as a Realist I am obligated to point out that international organizations such as NATO are pointless and irrelevant and also the greatest possible threat to peace and stability in the history of human social interaction.  I know this because I am extremely Realistic.

> Finally, as a Realist I wish you would acknowledge that proxy war as a tool of statecraft is entirely without precedent in the history of international relations until it was invented by dastardly, unrealistic liberals in early 2022.
