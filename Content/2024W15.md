&#x1F1F8;&#x1F1EA;🇪🇺  Folklistan eller folkilskan? Och journalister vill verkligen att Swexit blir en grej. Jag kanske är väldigt skyddad men jag uppfattar inte ett uppdämt kritik mot EU hos väljarkåren ([förutom SD då][micro-swexit]). Det ska bli intressant att se vilka nollor/nazister som avslöjas som dom andra 6 namnen på listan. Frugan tippar att en av dom är Hanif Bali!

Not sure of the total lack of coverage of the latest crazy anti-EU party in Sweden on the fediverse is good or bad.

For people who might care:

* the person who registered the party was thrown out as MEP of the local christian democrat party for first advocating for weed legalization, then playing footsie with the local populist ex-nazi party to "keep her job"
* but wait! The first person on the list isn't her, it's a previous reality show winner, ex-social democrat, millionaire from building refugee housing, and probably a patron of brothels. He sounds like a dime-store Trump
* the party has 6 other people on the list, but who they are is a mystery for now
* the party's website seemed to have been llm-generated, with bizarre mispellings and denoting existing MEP's as "traitors"

Journos here are ecstatic, at last something fun is happening with the EU elections! Some are really hoping \#swexit will be a thing, but realistically the only people interested in voting for these clowns are the ones already voting for the EU-skeptic ex-nazi party.

I wanted to see the latest Wim Wenders, but the kid wanted to see this, and we don't hang out much nowadays so it was worth it. It's fun but you have to be like six to not see the twist coming.

Low-key UK drama about the aftermath of the murder of a young black girl, soon to be adopted by a wealthy white family. Great acting but it does raise a lot of questions on how adoption allegedly works in the UK.
