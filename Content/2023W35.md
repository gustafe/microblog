The SFnal idea of the *Singularity* is when technological progress goes faster and faster until it disappears up the hockey stick curve of pure unknoweabilty. What's happening now in actuality is that hype cycles are crashing faster and faster. Blockchain! Self driving! LLM! 

Any takeoffs are going to run into the iron cloud cover of climate change anyway.

Hate the little briefcase Windows has added to the "Edge for Business" taskbar icon. Looks like a piece of poop stuck to the icon.

Also, briefcase as a symbol of work? How about something more appropriate, like a spycam.

> But I think the Justice Department is on solid legal footing. This isn’t quite the “novel theory” Storm’s defense attorneys claim, because Storm and Semenov are charged only with conspiracy: conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to run an unlicensed money transmission business, and conspiracy to violate sanctions on North Korea. They didn’t commit the crimes; they aided and abetted those who committed the actual crimes.

> [... the proof assistant] Lean [...] has allowed mathematicians to verify many proofs, while also helping the authors better understand their own work, because they have to break down some of their ideas into simpler steps to feed into Lean for verification.

> But is this foolproof? Is a proof a proof just because Lean agrees it’s one? In some ways, it’s as good as the people who convert the proof into inputs for Lean. Which sounds very much like how we do traditional mathematics.
