So presumably Twitter Blue is gonna be X Blue now, just to reinforce the porn feeling.

20 years after Spolsky's explainer about Unicode, "developers" are still edgily going online telling me it's too complicated and that ASCII should be enough for everyone.

#### [ðŸ”— John Tyndall rescues Julius Mayer, 1862](https://skullsinthestars.com/2023/07/31/john-tyndall-rescues-julius-mayer-1862/)

Nice piece of science history, and some lovely 19th century scientific lecturing quotes:

> The researches of Sir John Herschel and M. Pouillet have informed us of the annual expenditure of the sun as regards heat ; and by an easy calculation we ascertain the precise amount of the expenditure which falls to the share of our planet. Out of 2300 million parts of light and heat the earth receives one. The whole heat emitted by the sun in a minute would be competent to boil 12,000 millions of cubic miles of ice- cold water. How is this enormous loss made good? Whence is the sunâ€™s heat derived, and by what means is it maintained? No combustion, no chemical affinity with which we are acquainted would be competent to produce the temperature of the sunâ€™s surface. Besides, were the sun a burning body merely, its light and heat would assuredly speedily come to an end.

The grandson of Andrew Mellon ("Liquidate labor, liquidate stocks...") is bankrolling RFK Jr's ratfucking campaign. You can't make this shit up.

> A top Republican donor who helped fund Donald Trumpâ€™s past presidential runs is helping to bankroll Robert F Kennedy Jrâ€™s long-shot White House bid, as conservative cash keeps flowing to Joe Bidenâ€™s main challenger for the Democratic nomination.

> According to federal filings released on Monday, Timothy Mellon gave $5mn to American Values, the main political action committee, or outside spending group, supporting Kennedyâ€™s White House bid. Mellon, 81, is the grandson of Andrew Mellon, the former US Treasury secretary and senior banker, and a former executive in the transportation and infrastructure sector.

> Other top Kennedy supporters include Patrick Byrne, the former chief executive of Overstock.com, and venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, as well as a large contribution from a group funded by Silicon Valley investor David Sacks.

Just the best people. JFC.

I guess I should get mad about HN railing against "modern architecture", but it's a trope older than Hitler, and a disdain for modernism is a hallmark of the fashy reactionary. I just think it's weird that a community that celebrates its own deep knowledge of software development is so blithe to dismiss other professional fields. If I was to comment that functional programming is a needless complication I'd get pilloried, but someone who demands buildings feature Ionic columns is a seen to have Valid Concerns.

Another day, another programming language project with a shitty maintainer. Of course they are defended by fanboys employing DARVO tactics.

Amazing. X-Twitter subscribers can now hide the blue check, the one that was supposed to be a Veblen good, worth so much that selling it was gonna save Musk's bacon.

This piece on the Smithsonian website says that slavery in Viking society is "little-known". Well maybe if you're not from Scandinavia. The existence of thralls has always been a part of the history of these countries. I vaguely remember reading a YA novel on the theme too.

I suspect many modern-day admirers of the Vikings also know about this, and think it's commendable.

Ingen av bilderna visar heller nÃ¥gon situation dÃ¤r barn varit nÃ¤ra sexuellt innehÃ¥ll, Ã¤ven om det kollage BjÃ¶rn SÃ¶der sprider ger sken av det.

> Den fÃ¶rsta bilden Ã¤r av oklart ursprung, men bÃ¶rjar spridas av hbtqi-fientliga konton i sociala medier i maj efter att en person ur den danska konspirationstroende miljÃ¶n postat den. Den andra bilden Ã¤r av allt att dÃ¶ma tagen vid en dragshow i USA sommaren 2022 och sprids av transfobiska konton pÃ¥ plattformen X. Den tredje bildens ursprung gÃ¥r inte att faststÃ¤lla â€“ spÃ¥ren slutar vid en japansk porrsajt dÃ¤r bilden postas 2016, vilket ocksÃ¥ uppmÃ¤rksammats av journalisten [Jack Werner](https://twitter.com/kwasbeb/status/1687009977305616384?s=20) i en trÃ¥d pÃ¥ plattformen X.

Mentioned Gresham's Law in an online comment, but didn't link to the wiki page. Glad I didn't, because it bears the unmistakable signs of ideologically driven editing by goldbugs.
