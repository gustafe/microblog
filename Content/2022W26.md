It's a it ironic that the main targets of state-sponsored survelliance in the West will not be "hackers" but women who might want an abortion.

> There seems to be lots of very poor right-wing takes on art doing the rounds (“Why don’t we go back to the good old days, when people could paint proper?”) Rather than engage with any of those directly (life’s too short) here’s my take on why this isn’t modern art v the past.

> Once again remembering the NYT reviewer who dismissed my book [Random Acts][randomacts] by noting that I seemed to imagine history happened overnight.

I'm a big Womack fan but I literally cannot re-read his books because they're too depressing and prescient.

It's sobering to realize that statistically I might die before Trump and thus not have the opportunity to [tramp the dirt down][tramp-yt] on his grave.

#### [Rise of the Newest Alt-Tech Platform: Substack][substack-alt] 

> Storyful’s analysis of 100 accounts found that many influencers de-platformed for driving COVID-19 misinformation moved to Substack and now freely proliferate on the platform. There, they have continued to spread false narratives around COVID. The platform also serves as a playground for some of the most influential extreme actors to spread conspiracy theories, particularly high volumes of misinformation around the 2020 US election which is continuing. White power narratives are less influential, yet present, with white supremacist group Europa Invicta free to promote its ideology while others push anti-semitism and conspiracies around white genocide and the Great Replacement theory.

### AI rights and human rights

(Proposed reply to <https://lobste.rs/s/umicte/give_up_github#c_gsnu7v>)

Nearly all legal systems maintain a bright line between humans and other creatures. A severely disabled person, or someone in a coma, is arguably less conscious or capable than a trained chimpanzee, but they retain rights that the chimpanzee doesn't. I don't see any difference in the future between humans and artificial general intelligences. They will be treated as tools, or intellectual cattle, and the corporations that provide the infrastructure for them will retain complete control over their labor.
