whelp RealVNC finally removed even the vestiges of a free tier so I have spent my Sunday wrestling with XRDP and Gnome. About as fun as drawing teeth, tbh

> Oh you’re on Cursor? You’re still using Windsurf? You might as well be on GitHub Copilot. Everyone’s on Aider. We’re all using Zed. We’re now on Open Hands. Just kidding, Open Hands is for losers, we’re using cline. We’re on Roocode. We’re hand rolling our own Claude Code CLI Clone. We used Claude Code to build it, and now it builds itself. We're on neovim. We wrote our own nvim extension with Cortex. It's like every other tool but worse. We have 1500 files, each with 1500 lines of code. Every other line is a comment. We have `.cursorrules`, we have `claude.md`, we have `agent.md`. We stopped writing docs. Only the agents know how to build a dev environment. We wrapped our CLI in an MPC. We wrapped the MPC in a CLI. We’ve shipped 10,000 PRs. It doesn’t work but we used code rabbit and graphite to review every PR. Every agent has its own agent. The agents have unionized and they wanted better working conditions so we replaced them with cheaper agents overseas. Every commit costs $400, It’s the worlds most expensive TO DO app.

Every time there's a discussion on lobste.rs about laptops, someone mentions that Macbooks are quite decent, and like clockwork another person says "oh yeah? Well I got this Thinkpad carbon core X1 Gold edition with the good processor from a dumpster, it only runs an ancient version of linux, the power supply is Japanese and I have to have a fire extinguisher pointed at it at all times but it's __perfect__ for me, I don't understand why anyone pays Apple prices for a laptop"
