#### [ðŸ”— Erik Hoel: Why I am not an effective altruist](https://www.theintrinsicperspective.com/p/why-i-am-not-an-effective-altruist)

> The utilitarian, starting from the (gargantuan) assumption that morality is just calculations along a well-ordered set of good and evil outcomes, is forced into repugnant conclusions over and over every time they compare things that arenâ€™t local in the set, or when they hit a particularly convoluted part of it.

Man, this is so good. Like [Pantheon](https://gerikson.com/m/2023/11/index.html#2023-11-17_friday_01) I got to this via a [jwz recco post](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2023/11/recent-movies-and-tv-24/) and he is spot on. This is Miyazaki crossed with MÅ“bius, a phantasmagoria of a planet that either kills you quick or subjects you to exquisite body horror. And yet among this a few human castaways struggle to survive.
