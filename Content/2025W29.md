Every time there's a discussion on lobste.rs about laptops, someone mentions that Macbooks are quite decent, and like clockwork another person says "oh yeah? Well I got this Thinkpad carbon core X1 Gold edition with the good processor from a dumpster, it only runs an ancient version of linux, the power supply is Japanese and I have to have a fire extinguisher pointed at it at all times but it's __perfect__ for me, I don't understand why anyone pays Apple prices for a laptop"
