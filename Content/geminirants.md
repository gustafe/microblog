## 🤬 ennefftee

(Note: this was originally a draft document for a twitter thread but twitter sucks so I figured I'd post it here instead. Hence the rewordings of terms like 'NFT' to avoid getting noticed by pixelated monkey avatars.)

### Who benefits from boosting this crap? 

I find it fascinating that Ennefftee boosters have taken so many shits in so many punchbowls at so many parties it is now a net benefit to state your company will never use them. 

The N\FT sales pitch is: we will ruin your community to the detriment of the environment and to the benefit of a wealthy few. Capitalism in its purest form.  

The question is *why* so many internet firms (Twitter, Discord, Reddit, Patreon) are enthusiastically jumping in, to the horror of their users. 

There are big companies like  Disney, Burger King etc. that are minting tiffins. This is more understandable. They have giant marketing departments that are attuned to new trends in marketing. And ironically, they have pro IT departments that will ensure that the assets will actually stay up in the future, unlike the fly-by-night operations that just dump them on IPFS. At least if they get deleted from there they are still available in a giant torrent.

But when it comes to internet first companies, I believe it's a concerted effort from crapto boosters to get them onboard. Either by direct pitches to the bros in charge, or astroturfing social media campaigns.

In a weird way I'm looking forward to Twitter, at considerable expense to themselves, integrating digital trading cards into people's profiles. Approximately 1 minute after launch there will be blacklists available where people with pixelmonkey avatars can be ... BLOCKchained.

A great summary of the fundamental absurdity of this space:

### The "art" (sometimes) sucks

Look, I have a pretty liberal view on "art" in general. As far as I'm concerned, someone taking a pic of their kid, or singing karaoke, or writing this blog post, is engaged in creating art. "Art is dead", after all. So I'm not gonna go all gatekeeping in saying that Leonardo da Vinci was an artist, while the creator of Cryptopunks is not.

Of course, that means that the vast majority of art is economically worthless. Related, just because it's hard to do doesn't mean the product is worth anything. Just ask someone who has problem passing stools.

And the fact remains that most of the art "protected" by NFTs is objectively bad. The ideal NFT target is:

* recognizable in a Twitter profile pic
* easily varied to produce 10,000 "unique" pictures
* referencing the ideals of the target: people who aspire to be idle rich assholes

So creating an NFT concept is akin to being a copyrighter. Worthy occupation, but hardly on the scale of Michelangelo.

## 🤬 Fucking Twitter - or rather, fucking Elon

This is depressing as heck. I am convinced Twitter will become even worse, very quickly. The global right is stirring and will use Twitter in its war against decency.

I'm probably not gonna be directly affected because I'm a cis white male, but I really feel bad for "designated targets" *already* having a tough time there. And I really don't want to continue to feed the beast.

Even if people move on to somewhere else, a sort of meta-community will be fractured, and the bad guys have won another battle.

## 🤬 Fuck web3

* [originally a comment on Lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/s/wcggoi/web3_fraud#c_evyb4e)

What pisses me off about the people promoting “web3” is that they assume the future of the web is __artificial scarcity__. It’s a 180 from the promise and reality of the web - that information, on the margin, is free to reproduce infinitely. Instead of the values of open source and CC0 content we’re supposed to believe that card collectors and stock speculators are the ones to shape the future.

There is nothing in the debased vision that these people present that attracts me - and I say that as someone who is fully prepared to pay money for goods and services online. I refuse to pay inflated prices to greedy middlemen who will just clear-cut field after field of creative endeavor to pump their useless tokens.

## 🤬 GDPR, privacy, ad-blocking

* [Inspired by this comment thread](https://lobste.rs/s/wnkloa/gdpr_enforcer_rules_iab_europe_s_consent#c_ynvg5s)

I'm pretty convinced the reason Google hasn't come down hard on adblocking extensions to Chrome (despite it hurting their bottom line) is that allowing them gives them plausible cover from any sort of serious user data protection legislation. The inherent libertarian tendencies of the internet takes care of the rest. "Fuck you, got mine" is its mantra.

Expecting online privacy exploitation to be solved by installing browser extensions that are allowed on the sufferance of the world's largest advertizer is the height of atomistic individualism. 

The GDPR is far from perfect. But it's still distressing to see "privacy activists" in the USA dismiss it because of their built-in aversion to any sort of collective action directed by a state.

## 🤬 GNU's not Unix, and that's the point

A weird inversion has taken place as Linux has become by far the most deployed kernel in the world: its success helped by using the GNU toolchain and software, it is now derided for not following "Unix standards".

What are these standards? They are called POSIX, and was forced on the varied *commercial* Unix vendors to ensure a bare minimum of compatibility. None of the vendors had the clout to completely dominate the market, so they agreed on something that would theoretically enable a customer to move their expensive software to another system.

POSIX defines Unix, which is still a legal trademark. The FSF's goal was not to create a Unix, it was to create a new system that built on the concepts of Unix but made it better.

That's why some GNU utilities don't conform to the POSIX standards - they're not Unix. That's why autotools and friends are so fiendishly complex - they were designed to be used on multiple different architectures, many which didn't even ship with free C compilers. The point wasn't to make a bargain-basement, tick-the-boxes Unix - it was to make a new system, better than Unix, which could be used with the FSF kernel - the Hurd.

Enter Linux. Linus Torvalds is my age, and at the time I didn't know that much about the nuances of free vs permissive licenses. Nor was RMS such a polarizing figure. 386BSD was in personal and legal trouble. The very legality of BSD-derived code was in question. Using the GNU tools, which were expressedly designed to avoid legal issues, was a no-brainer. It was a much different time than now, when "open source" is an accepted term, and the uncompromising stance of the FSF and its founder are seen as fringe, not mainstream, among developers.

Linux has been succesful beyond anyone's wildest dreams in the 1990s - but it hasn't been smooth sailing. There was the Free Software / Open Source split, the SCO lawsuit, the growing pains of having a hobby project grow up *BIG*, but through it all GNU software kept chugging along.

The people online now telling me snidely to use musl instead of glibc, or some hipster shell instead of `bash`, or who whine about how autotools has to support PA-RISC, or who seem to think POSIX is a goal to strive for rather than an accident of corporate history, are standing on the shoulders of giants. But instead of being grateful they're complaining the giants are coding it wrong.

## 🤬 IRC vs its enemies

Services like Slack, Discord and Teams have proven IRC right - group chat is an important collaboration tool. IRC apologists constantly complain that these services are winning despite IRC being better because it's "open" and "decentralized".

If IRC is as good as people say, I would have expected a turnkey solution be available for organizations. This would include:

* server/service with backup and management options
* integration into access systems such as ADFS, Okta etc
* client config to enable logging (mandatory in some businesses)
* full-text searching

Even for a nominal fee this could have been competitive, probably.

But it never appeared. In fact, during the Freenode debacle, the FSF explicitely stated that they as an organization did not have the resources to be running a public IRC server.

The fact is that the IRC ecosystem is immature, inconsistent, hard to manage, and not really business-friendly. And that's fine. But it also means that Slack et al solved a problem IRC wasn't interested in solving.

## 🤬 Incorrect Quotation

RMS would like you to know that the infamous "GNU/Linux" copy-pasta attributed to him is incorrect.

* [RMS](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/incorrect-quotation.html)

Here it is, in its incorrect entirety:

> I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called “Linux,” and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use.

> Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called “Linux” distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.

So what parts are incorrect?

Here they are:

> unto itself

> another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX

Incidentally I am glad for this because I wrote a previous rant which implied that GNU was *not* POSIX, then I saw this copy-pasta and was briefly worried I was incorrect. Turns out I wasn't!

* [previous rant](https://gerikson.com/m/2021/10/index.html#2021-10-31_gnu_01)

What I find fascinating about this quote is that RMS takes full credit for the infamous opening sentences, which are generally all that most copy-pasters bother with. Impressive.

Also this backhanded compliment:

> The main error is that Linux is *not* strictly speaking part of the GNU system—whose kernel is GNU Hurd. The version with Linux, we call “GNU/Linux.” It is OK to call it “GNU” when you want to be really short, but it is better to call it “GNU/Linux” so as to give Torvalds some credit.

"so as to give Torvalds some credit", smdh.

I'd just like to interject for a moment: GNU/Hurd is never gonna be finished. Linux won. Get over it.

## substack is a toxic brand

This post on Wonkette articulates a lot of what I've been seeing regarding Substack lately

* [Anti-Vaxxers: There's Gold In Them Thar Substacks!](https://www.wonkette.com/anti-vaxxers-discover-there-s-gold-in-them-thar-substacks)

Substack.com links submitted to Hacker News are usually flagged within minutes (which is significant, because Substack are a YC-backed company and have been aggressively recruiting on HN). They are full of anti-vax articles and general right-wing culture war trash. Seeing 'substack.com' in the URL is a good indicator that the content will be alt-right or worse.

I won't pay for anything on substack, and I will actively try to flag / delete links to it on social media. There are plenty of competing services for blogging+newsletter. Use them instead of supporting VC-funded alt-right Freeze Peach extremists. 

### Edit: Wed 23 Feb 2022

Sadly user 'ykevinator2 got flagged to death for this comment but I think it's quite apt

> I still don't know what substack is but it seems like a place for intelligent nutcases to explain why they're victims.
