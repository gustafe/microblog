It's been an unusually cool Spring here so it's only today I've shifted from winter/low-temp tyres to summer wheels.

Last year I got a hydraulic jack to make it a bit easier. 

It was hard work for all that, but it is Int'l Labor Day, after all.

### "Fifty Years After the Fair"

[This song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdnO-kV8h3s) from Aimee Mann's solo debut *Whatever* is really weird. It's an upbeat pop song about the 1939 World's Fair. I don't really know what prompted Mann to write it, but it's pretty unusual for that subject to be covered in popular music.

That said, I really love *Whatever*. There are some great songs, like "4th of July" and "I've Had It", along with another left-field song: "Mr. Harris", about a May-December romance.

### Austrian economics - a twitter thread by @davetroy

[Thread starts here](https://twitter.com/davetroy/status/1522725897706614785)

> Austrian Economics (gold, crypto) is rooted in a desire to make the world work in the way some people think it *should* work.

> The problem is‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt actually work that way, unless you are a sociopath. And even then, there are limits.

> Some examples‚Ä¶

> ‚ÄúPeople will move to where tax rates are cheaper,‚Äù they say. But most people don‚Äôt choose where they live based on tax rates. Sociopaths do, sometimes. Time after time this analysis never holds up, despite the alarming chatter. <https://t.co/HSjMRK1H40>

> The other big myth is that increasing the monetary supply *alone* contributes to inflation. In the current moment, we know that cartel influence over energy prices gives the oil+gas industry special leverage outside of monetary supply.

> Inflation doesn‚Äôt always directly correlate to increased monetary supply; and oil+gas cartels can ‚Äújuke the stats‚Äù to achieve whatever outcome they like. As usual, complex chaotic systems don‚Äôt lend themselves to reductive theses. Behavioral economics and complexity theory exist for a reason, to understand *actual* vs. surmised behavior. Why would proponents go to such lengths to disregard actual behavior and reality to impose their deductive (wrong) ideas about how money works on everyone? Because they think it will advantage them.

> It also enables various shady activities and Ponzi schemes; crypto is just playing back every financial scheme ever invented before regulators catch up. Tech often is a medium through which social misfits and miscreants reshape the world in ways that make them comfortable and fit in. Rather than try to adapt to a world they don‚Äôt understand, they wish to remake the world in a way that suits their view of it.

> We should all resist this. We definitely need to have big hairy messy conversations about money and its regulation. But reliance on poorly conceived and mostly wrong frameworks that make sense primarily to teen boys and sociopaths, and has no bearing on data, human behavior, or reality, is not the way. It‚Äôs time to discard this bad hand and move on.
