It's been an unusually cool Spring here so it's only today I've shifted from winter/low-temp tyres to summer wheels.

Last year I got a hydraulic jack to make it a bit easier. 

It was hard work for all that, but it is Int'l Labor Day, after all.

### "Fifty Years After the Fair"

[This song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdnO-kV8h3s) from Aimee Mann's solo debut *Whatever* is really weird. It's an upbeat pop song about the 1939 World's Fair. I don't really know what prompted Mann to write it, but it's pretty unusual for that subject to be covered in popular music.

That said, I really love *Whatever*. There are some great songs, like "4th of July" and "I've Had It", along with another left-field song: "Mr. Harris", about a May-December romance.

### Austrian economics - a twitter thread by @davetroy

[Thread starts here](https://twitter.com/davetroy/status/1522725897706614785)

> Austrian Economics (gold, crypto) is rooted in a desire to make the world work in the way some people think it *should* work.

> The problem is‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt actually work that way, unless you are a sociopath. And even then, there are limits.

> Some examples‚Ä¶

> ‚ÄúPeople will move to where tax rates are cheaper,‚Äù they say. But most people don‚Äôt choose where they live based on tax rates. Sociopaths do, sometimes. Time after time this analysis never holds up, despite the alarming chatter. <https://t.co/HSjMRK1H40>

> The other big myth is that increasing the monetary supply *alone* contributes to inflation. In the current moment, we know that cartel influence over energy prices gives the oil+gas industry special leverage outside of monetary supply.

> Inflation doesn‚Äôt always directly correlate to increased monetary supply; and oil+gas cartels can ‚Äújuke the stats‚Äù to achieve whatever outcome they like. As usual, complex chaotic systems don‚Äôt lend themselves to reductive theses. Behavioral economics and complexity theory exist for a reason, to understand *actual* vs. surmised behavior. Why would proponents go to such lengths to disregard actual behavior and reality to impose their deductive (wrong) ideas about how money works on everyone? Because they think it will advantage them.

> It also enables various shady activities and Ponzi schemes; crypto is just playing back every financial scheme ever invented before regulators catch up. Tech often is a medium through which social misfits and miscreants reshape the world in ways that make them comfortable and fit in. Rather than try to adapt to a world they don‚Äôt understand, they wish to remake the world in a way that suits their view of it.

> We should all resist this. We definitely need to have big hairy messy conversations about money and its regulation. But reliance on poorly conceived and mostly wrong frameworks that make sense primarily to teen boys and sociopaths, and has no bearing on data, human behavior, or reality, is not the way. It‚Äôs time to discard this bad hand and move on.

### Rasmus Paludan and "free speech"

Rasmus Paludan is a craven little shitweasel and I hope he meets the fate he deserves as soon as possible.

[@ChrChristensen thread](https://twitter.com/ChrChristensen/status/1525043012694327296?s=20)

> Danish far-right "activist" Rasmus Paludan burnt 3 Qur'ans in Sweden yesterday. There's a tendency to claim that people who criticize these acts are "against free speech." That's not only intellectually juvenile, but shows a lack of understanding about how free speech works.

> Critiquing the MANNER in which free speech is exercised isn't the same thing as saying the right should be revoked or speech banned. For example, I was opposed to the US occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan. I was also opposed to any bans on protesting against these occupations.

> But, if anti-war protesters staged a protest at the funeral of a soldier killed in the war with signs saying the solder deserved to die, I'd critique both the MANNER and CONTENT of their speech. That doesn't mean I'd ban either their right to gather or their right to speak.

> Citizens exercising their free speech rights to question how others have exercised their free speech rights is actually the perfect crystallization of free speech and democratic engagement in action. To suggest hard critique of speech stifles free speech is counterintuitive.

> When Paludan wraps his Islamophobia in "free speech," don't be surprised if others exercise their rights to then call out what they consider a transparent attack on a religious group. Labeling those who do so as "anti-free speech" is, ironically, an attempt to stifle speech.

> Journalists, politicians, pundits forever whine about behavior that's perfectly legal, but they consider anti-social. The message? Just because you have the right to do something doesn't mean it's the right/responsible/democratic decision. Precisely what critics tell Paludan.

> It's amusing to see opinion leaders who spend a huge amount of time telling citizens about the "correct" and "incorrect" way to exercise their freedoms -- like, say, telling Muslim women what they should wear -- suddenly wetting their pants when Qur'an-burners are criticized.

> What this comes down to is how framing of freedoms/rights varies dramatically depending on whose rights are discussed. Paludan? Then it's the letter of the law that matters. Immigrants? Well, then we begin to critique based on things like "values." Legal rights less important.

### [HTML Only](https://lobste.rs/s/s4jsru/html_only)

Interesting submission about a super simple way to blog. 

I must say I'm pleasantly surprised how fast this blog setup is. All data (basically most tweets since 2007 plus stuff I've written since the end of April) is 1.8MB of text in fortune format, and takes under 3s to render to HTML from Markdown.

Anyway, people should do whatever. I've long held the opinion that manually writing HTML/XML (closing tags etc) is a huge pain, and the advent of Markdown was a sweet release from that pain. For some unfathomable reason static site generators have ballooned in complexity. If you just want a frikkin' site, MD + some perl has you covered.

#### 12:45, West of W√ºrzburg

Heading home. First leg is on an ICE train that's actually on time and has A/C, so that's good.

Thought I had scored a row to myself only for flustered young woman from a delayed flight to plonk herself down in it.

On the train home.

Funny how the things we thought were super cool when they were in the future, like using a computer on a train, are now just mundane.

There may be nuggets of precious metal submerged in the offal that fills places like LessWrong but I for one am not inclined to sift it to find them.

### systemd.path vs make

I used to build this blog on demand using a simple make recipe, but I've long wanted to move it to being built if a file is changed. 

Inspired by [this post](https://me.rbel.co/posts/lists-sh-hacks/)[1], I managed to get it going, with some trial and error. 

Specifically, in addition to running the command 

    systemctl --user enable microblog.{path,service}

I also had to run 
	
    systemctl --user start microblog.path 

The entire process (9.8k entries) takes around 3s. I'm pondering "optimizing" it but don't know if it's worth it.

[1] that post pertains to <https://lists.sh>, which is an interesting service if you're into list-based microblogging.

### RIP my permalinks

I implemented a better format for the permalink fragments based on the post title. So if you have bookmarked anything, sucks to be you. Also the feeds might go crazy. Sorry.

I'm happy I quit interacting with Gemini  before I read this [tripe][metric], otherwise I would have been compelled to respond to it.

Also LOL at this HN comment<sup>\*</sup>

> Money, more than anything is an amplifier, and it has amplified a neuro-atypical man with an unbalanced ego and actual political opinions you might not agree with. He is a real person with massive accomplishments who has enough money to firmly grab the wheel on the ship of our country, not some cardboard cutout of good or evil.

And that's what's scary about Fusk.

2022-05-29 Taking a break

I've decided to take a break from social media, IRC, and sites like lobste.rs and Reddit. 

My incessant tweeting and chatting was getting in the way of <strike>Elden Ring</strike> my actual work. 

More seriously, the current state of the world is increasingly getting me down, and social media isn't helping. I'm not giving up, but I need to refocus my energies in more positive directions.

This blog will still be updated but I'll try to cut down on the snark and negativity.
