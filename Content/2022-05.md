It's been an unusually cool Spring here so it's only today I've shifted from winter/low-temp tyres to summer wheels.

Last year I got a hydraulic jack to make it a bit easier. 

It was hard work for all that, but it is Int'l Labor Day, after all.

### "Fifty Years After the Fair"

[This song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdnO-kV8h3s) from Aimee Mann's solo debut *Whatever* is really weird. It's an upbeat pop song about the 1939 World's Fair. I don't really know what prompted Mann to write it, but it's pretty unusual for that subject to be covered in popular music.

That said, I really love *Whatever*. There are some great songs, like "4th of July" and "I've Had It", along with another left-field song: "Mr. Harris", about a May-December romance.

If you call yourself a "free speech absolutist" in 2022, you're either hopelessly na√Øve or a dedicated swallower of fascism.

### Natofr√•gan

Jag √§r kluven i fr√•gan om Sverige ska ansluta sig till NATO. Men jag tycker att det √§r viktigt att Sverige har ett starkt och avskr√§ckande f√∂rsvar. Om ett NATO-medlemskap √§r det som kr√§vs f√∂r att det ska vara fallet s√• kanske det √§r b√§st √§nd√•.

### "We need to intubate!"

I wonder if there's any episode of "E.R." where they *don't* intubate someone.

(in this episode, they intubate __two__ people.)

Well today could have started better.

(context: a draft decision to overturn *Roe vs. Wade* was leaked from the US Supreme Court. Abortion rights in the US are under concerted attack by misogynist ideologues, closely tied to the global Right)

Oh, and there's a tired re-hash of "free speech" on Gemini. Here's [my take](https://gerikson.com/m/2022/05/index.html#2022-05-01_05).

Oh fuck here come the bad Star Wars puns we've all definitely never heard before.

Where we're at it, what's the Jedi religion's stance on abortion? The one example we've seen in the movies show that the life of the mother isn't really a priority...
