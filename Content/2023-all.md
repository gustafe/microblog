Known crazy bitcoiner / sedevacantist Luke-JR has been hacked [according to his Twitter](https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/1609613748364509184?s=20). Personally I think it's more likely his Twitter account has been compromised, but let's live in hope that 2023 starts with him getting all his coins jacked.

*Update:* Peter Todd [confirms it's Luke tweeting](https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/1609655629903265795?s=20).

As another data point, Luke's mastodon account hasn't posted since 25 Dec 2022, so Twitter is not dead yet...

Russia produced a wire-guided antitank missile called "Konkurs" which means "contest" in Russian but "bankruptcy" in Swedish.

Interested in the etymology I consulted [SAOB](https://www.saob.se/artikel/?unik=K_1987-0305.Ax2Q) and was informed the Swedish term is from Latin *concursus*, an assembly of people (creditors in this case), so they have the same root.

But this will always be disagreeable to someone like Yarvin, who doubts that most people are capable of political maturity and thinks a few “dark elves” like himself should be in charge because only they are grown-up enough to exercise power effectively. The irony is that the whole tone of Yarvin’s rhetoric is one of perpetual adolescence: obsessed with status, blinded by delusions of grandeur, and impatient with the negotiations and compromises of ordinary political life.

### &#x1F1F8;&#x1F1EA; förklara igen för mig hur den fria marknaden gör oss alla rikare

OK så Sverige är bra på att producera el. Eftersom övriga Europa inte är lika bra eller vill ha mer el så säljer vi elen till dom till priset dom är villiga att betala - ett högt pris. Samma pris tas ut av svenska konsumenter och företag. Ju mer el vi har att sälja, ju högre blir priset. Elproducenterna tjäner multum. Alla andra får vända på slantarna. Konsumptionen går ner. Företag får lägga ner. Samhällets kostnader, i form av ökad arbetslöshet, extra ersättning till hushåll, samt minskad skatteintäkter går upp. 

Finns det någon plan att ta igen dessa kostnader? Hur kommer priset på el i Europa Sverige tillgodo? En stor del av infrastrukturen för el har byggts upp med offentliga medel. Sveriges hushåll och industrier har byggts upp kring en ide av tillgång till rimligt prissatt el. Det går inte att ändra vanor i en handvändning. Det kräver i sig en massa pengar och tid.

Jag har hört argumentet att det är bra att vi är i en fri marknad för el. Att när andra länder i Europa sätter prisstak för att skydda sina medborgare så slösar dom mer el. Om alla var under samma pristryck skulle elkonsumptionen och därmed priserna gå ned.

Men nu är vi inte det. Majoriteten av EUs invånare  betalar inte fullpris på sin el, trots att dom har brist. Sverige säljer gärna och tar betalt av deras regeringar, så hamnar pengarna i elbolagens fickor. Där stannar dom, medan vår regering försöker komma på sätt att lindra den värsta plågan.

Varför ska vi vara gossen Duktig i frihandelsfrågan? Sätt Sverigpris på el, låt Sverige använda den el vi behöver för vår industri och vårt uppehälle, och ta fajten med EU kommissionen om ett år eller så.

### An alternative end to WW2 in Japan

The podcast "We have ways of making you talk" had Phillips O'Brian as a guest in episode 163 ([Overcast link](https://overcast.fm/+RU8FlX3kY/00:23)) and he mentioned something I've never heard of before.

Roosevelt's chief of staff, [Adm. William Leahy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_D._Leahy), was against using the atomic bomb on Japan. It would be akin to using poison gas, as as far as anyone knew the radioactivity might have made the land uninhabitable. 

He was also against an invasion of the home islands. Instead, Japan would be isolated, preventing it from waging war. 

Of course no food or supplies would reach Japan, and considering the already straightened circumstances there at war's end, it's possible that millions of people would die from starvation or disease.

Manchuria would have probably fallen to the Soviets just as it did in real life, and bombing raids would probably have continued, along with shore bombardment and aerial strikes from ships close by. These would cause additional deaths (the firebombing of Tokyo in 1945 led to a death toll of 100,000 with a million homeless).

### A more relaxed Elden Ring build (INT)

I started my 2nd character as a spellblade, high INT but not a pure caster. I focused on DEX and used Moonveil, but never really got into it. Juggling ranged spells was tricky, and Moonveil didn't have the damage I was used to from using greatswords with my first character. Just before Maliketh I created a new character and started playing with that instead. 

Then I stumbled across [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OjR4Ot-c6A) and Was Intrigued. I decided to try it out. I respecced (basically DEX -> STR) and upgraded the Dark Moon Greatsword[1]. 

And oh man is it nicer. DMGS is so FP efficient, just buff it then strong attack for days and stamina. Just having a couple ranged spells removes a bunch of clicking around to find what you want. The original build included a shield but I skipped that because I was quite used to playing without a shield in my other characters.

Using this setup I breezed through some stuff I've been avoiding, like Lichdragon Fortissax, and had no problems dealing with Maliketh and the penultimate bosses.

The French Republican calender was supposed to embody the universality of Man, but the month names are based on the local climate of France (Northern France at that). Via Wikipedia:

> The Republican calendar year began the day the autumnal equinox occurred in Paris, and had twelve months of 30 days each, which were given new names based on nature, principally having to do with the prevailing weather in and around Paris and sometimes evoking the Medieval Labors of the Months.

* Autumn:
  * Vendémiaire (from French vendange, derived from Latin vindemia, "vintage")
  * Brumaire (from French brume, "mist")
  * Frimaire (from French frimas, "frost")
* Winter:
  * Nivôse (from Latin nivosus, "snowy")
  * Pluviôse (from French pluvieux, derived from Latin pluvius, "rainy")
  * Ventôse (from French venteux, derived from Latin ventosus, "windy")
* Spring:
  * Germinal (from French germination)
  * Floréal (from French fleur, derived from Latin flos, "flower")
  * Prairial (from French prairie, "meadow")
* Summer:
  * Messidor (from Latin messis, "harvest")
  * Thermidor (or Fervidor) (from Greek thermon, "summer heat")
  * Fructidor (from Latin fructus, "fruit")

Speaking of Roald Dahl, here's a good overview in the NYRB. Spoiler, he was a bit of a shit <https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2022/12/22/making-it-big-roald-dahl-teller-of-the-unexpected/>

This is also very funny considering the recent right-wing freakout over "editorial meddling" in Dahl's works:

> [Dahl's biographer] Treglown, by contrast, makes it clear that the published version of *Matilda* owes a great deal more to the interventions of Dahl’s editor, Stephen Roxburgh, than it does to his romantic awakening. The Matilda of Dahl’s first draft was “born wicked” and most likely based on Hilaire Belloc’s poem “Matilda”: “Matilda told such Dreadful Lies,/It made one Gasp and stretch one’s Eyes.” This Matilda tortured her kind parents, declared war on her cross-dressing, mustachioed headmistress, and used her powers not to read but to fix a horse race so that her favorite teacher, Miss Hayes, a compulsive gambler, could pay off her debts.

> Roxburgh gave Dahl everything that makes *Matilda* appealing: Matilda’s unassuming intelligence, the horrendous Wormwoods, the dovelike Miss Honey. He shaped Dahl’s lazy nonsense into a story, with a beginning, middle, and end. Those of us who gained both our early, envious love of literature and a sense of its cultural imperilment from *Matilda* must offer thanks to Roxburgh. Certainly, Dahl did not. When he realized that *Matilda* was not officially under contract, he refused to do further edits and demanded a greater share of the royalties than [illustrator Quentin] Blake.

*Update, Wed 22 February 2023:* Wonkette has a good overview over how the anti-woke sausage was made: [Oh No! Roald Dahl's Publisher Made Some Really Dumb Edits And Now Free Speech Is Over](https://www.wonkette.com/oh-no-roald-dahl-s-publisher-made-some-really-dumb-edits-and-now-free-speech-is-over). Note that this entire thing is market-based, the market for children/YA readers is fierce and it's really easy to get on the wrong side of buyers. Whether this is cancel culture or not is debatable, what's not debatable is that the market for racist right-wing views is understandably small.

The statements "giant company makes record profits" and "giant company treats customers like shit" are in no way in opposition. Yet many commentators expect that the more money a company makes, the nicer it can afford to be to its customers. The cause and effect is the other way around, the more awful it is, the more money it makes. 

Likewise, people are surprised that a company spends profits buying back its own shares, thereby enriching shareholders, instead of for example investing in maintenance or infrastructure or lower prices. The shareholders are the owners! The company exists to make them richer! Customers pay the company so the company can pay shareholders. This is not rocket science, yet the current cult of "the free market solves all problems" lead to this fallacy, that companies exist to make society better, instead of making shareholders richer.

> But of course the Soviet Union *was* and Russia *is* an empire, in all of the most literal ways that a political entity can be characterized as “imperial.” It controlled vast territories populated by a huge number of ethnic groups organized with a clear racial and ideological hierarchy, and managed these territories through a wide array of political arrangements. It was (and is) not fashionable to describe Poland or Hungary as Soviet colonies, but they certainly were constituent elements of the Soviet empire, differentiated from Estonia and Ukraine only by some mild differences in governance structure.

> [...] Folks who have no problem understanding why the citizens of Vietnam hate France struggle to understand why Poles or Ukrainians have negative feelings towards Russia. And unfortunately in the context of Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, folks are reluctant to frame Russia’s behavior towards Ukraine as part of its long-term colonial project towards Eastern Europe.

  Och han som slogs och stred  
  får på böjda knän och med huv'et lågt  
  ta emot den starkes fred  
  Och när sen tungan slitits ur hans mun  
  och hans ögon skrapats ut  
  och när ben och armar bundits 'hop  
  med övermaktens knut  
  när han har fått en trasa i sin mun  
  så att ingen hör ett ljud  
  då har allting blivit normalt igen  
  och ett krig har tagit slut  

> Och med freden kommer tystnaden  
  Allt ordnas underhand  
  Och folk och länder styckas upp  
  i samförståndets namn  
  "Så tag du halva jorden, bror  
  och halva månen med  
  så tar jag andra halvan  
  så är vi bägge två tillfreds"  
  Om man då kämpar mot förtryck och hot  
  för den frihet som man valt  
  då blir varje krig en segerstrid  
  och varje fred ett nederlag

> But it appeared blind to the risk that cash pouring in was a symptom of low interest rates that could reverse if they rose. Central banks often increase rates to tamp overexuberance among investors, decisions that generally lead to a slowing of investment in speculative companies such as technology start-ups. SVB’s bond portfolio was exposed to rising rates and so too were its deposits.

### A coffee lifehack

I enjoy coffee but am not fanatic about it. My wife wants really strong coffee and lots of it. So we use a French press which makes it both strong and plentiful. We use an electric kettle to boil the water. 

Because I enjoy milk in my coffee but also want hot coffee, since time out of mind I have been warming a half cup of milk in a microwave for 30s. I call this "kaffe olle", a play on the Swedish ad campaign for *café au lait* in the late 80s which was bankrolled by the dairy producers. 

This Spring we ordered a new fancy microwave, and a relative moved and needed a microwave. So they got our old one. However the delivery of the new one was delayed, so I was faced with a week without a (convenient) way to warm my milk. Bummer.

On the same day we were to take delivery of the new microwave, I realized I could use a small amount of leftover hot water to pour into a small bowl, in which I had placed my cup with milk. So while waiting for the coffee in the French press to steep to completion, the milk was warmed by the water that had been used for the coffee. 

I can't believe I didn't figure this out before.

Crazy ole Balaji Srinavasan is betting BTC will hit 1M USD within 90 days, presumably because the dollar will hyperinflate.[1] 

That reminded me that I used to have a watchlist of similar predictions on the old version of my BTC price tracker[2]. Let's see how those went.

* 2018-07-06: can't even remember who ("Hashflare cloud mining liquidation, Jun 2018") predicted 8k USD, actual price: $6,673.50 (-16.6%)
* 2018-07-30: McAfee (RIP) (Jun 2018) predicted 15k USD, actual price: $8,180.48 (-45.5%)
* 2018-12-31: @cryptomanran (Feb 2018) predicted 100k USD, actual price: $3,742.70 (-96.3%)
* 2018-12-31: Tom Lee (Nov 2018) predicted 15k USD, actual price: $3,742.70 (-75.0%)
* 2020-08-31: 4chan biz (Jun 2018) predicted 100k USD, actual price: $11,680.82 (-88.3%)
* 2020-12-31: McAfee predicted 1M USD, actual price: $29,001.72 (-97.1%)
* 2021-11-01: BitcoinMarkets post predicted 130k, actual price: $61,004.41 (-53.1%)
* 2022-06-01: [some rando on /r/Buttcoin](https://redd.it/an5kjp) (Feb 2019) predicted 120k USD, actual price: $29,799.08 (-75.2%)
* 2022-12-31: Tim Draper predicted 250k USD, actual price: $16,547.50 (-93.4%)

Let's add @balajis to the list:

* 2023-06-17: predicted 1M USD (Mar 2023), actual price: ???

*Update, Tue 21 March 2023:* I've added a live diff between the current price and the 1M USD target [here](https://gerikson.com/btcticker/index.html#balajis). Currently he is ~972k off.

*Update, Sat 06 May 2023:* the [bet was settled on 02 Mar](https://twitter.com/jdcmedlock/status/1653452817179508736). The world is safe from hyperinflation... for now. 

#### Methodology

Prices are from [Yahoo!](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD?p=BTC-USD), I've used the "Adj. close" value for the day in question. 

The percentages are `(actual-prediction)/prediction*100`.

🦞 there's a discussion on lobste.rs about creating a new `llm` tag to enable filtering of stories about Chat-GPT and friends.[1]

My take: 

> We’re clearly on the <strike>upswing of a hype cycle</strike>cusp of the Singularity. The best thing to do is to <strike>go down to the pub</strike>block the `ai` tag, have a pint, and wait for the whole thing to blow over.

--- 

[1] tags on lobste.rs work a bit differently than on other sites. On the one hand they (attempt to) define what is on topic for the site. On the other, users can either subscribe to them or *filter* them. I don't have hard numbers but I suspect more people filter than subscribe. 

%

Reading about the Norwegian ammo factory not being able to expand because a TikTok data center is sucking up all the power prompts me to believe that when AI takes over, it won't because it will design weapons to kill us, it will be by denying humans the resources to grow food and get clean water. We will starve in the heat exhaust of raw oil-fuelled data centers producing generated cat videos for automated likes.

Januari [skrev jag](https://gerikson.com/m/2023/01/index.html#2023-01-06_friday_01):

> vi ska kanske vara tacksamma att Orbán inte fick för sig att kräva förbud av HBTQ-personer i Sverige för att släppa in oss i NATO. Billström hade kanske gått med på det också.

Det ser ut som om Orbán och hans hejdukar inom Fidesz har haft mer is i magen än Erdoğan och väntat ut processen lite för att nu ställa obefogade krav på Sveriges.

[SVT Text: ”Ungern: Tre skäl att dröja med ja”](https://texttv.nu/109/ungern-tre-skal-att-droja-med-ja-34588744)

> Skälen är att Sverige underminerar relationerna till Ungern, en ”moralisk överlägsenhet”  från svensk sida, ”brist respekt”  och att relationen mellan länderna försämrats över åren. 

Inget av det här berör inträde i NATO. Det ända som gäller är att Sverige ställer upp till Ungerns försvar om Ungern angrips, något som Orbán antagligen inte räknar med eftersom han skulle välkomna Putin med öppna armar.

Återigen -- om ett medlemskap i NATO kräver att vi tummar på vår självständighet och våra rättigheter ska vi inte gå med.

I really suggest reading RUSI's report on Russia's intelligence efforts in Ukraine before the invasion ([linked yesterday](https://gerikson.com/m/2023/03/index.html#2023-03-29_wednesday_02), [direct PDF link](https://static.rusi.org/202303-SR-Unconventional-Operations-Russo-Ukrainian-War-web-final.pdf.pdf)). 

It's a fascinating piece and sheds light on a lot of decisions that seemed weird at the time. Basically, the FSB had recruited "super-agents" who ran their own networks of people who probably didn't know they were ultimately working for Russia. Putin put the invasion plans in motion too soon, so these traitors didn't really have that much of an effect, while the military component of the invasion was predicated on Ukraine being paralyzed by their actions. 

So what does this mean for countries a bit outside Russia's "near abroad"? I don't believe Sweden, for example, is in imminent danger of Russian invasion even in the longer term. But Russia is probably using this playbook right now (just as in every country) where it's funding agents who recruit on their own, acting as cutouts for Russian money and influence.

Hopefully this report gives Western security services new ideas and leads.

There's so much in this piece...  but we were all young once.

This just struck me as weird, as a part of a freshman comparison of Japanese and "Western" cultural traits:

> Faustian building techniques birth disasters like the Marshall fires in Louisville, Colorado (the town I grew up in) where a thousand poorly-built homes burned, and they also make repairs more akin to total redoes. These defects don't matter though, because infinite spatial and temporal resources mean that the marginal cost of replacing a burned-down house to the Faustian civilization as a whole approaches zero. To the Island metaphysic, however, one thousand homes burning could be catastrophic because of spatially-dictated material constraints.

Tokyo alone endured both the [Great Kantō Earthquake in 1923](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1923_Great_Kant%C5%8D_earthquake)[1] that killed an estimated 100,000 people, mostly due to firestorms, and the [Operation Meetinghouse bombing raid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Tokyo_(10_March_1945)) in 1945 that also killed around 100,000 people. This bombing was of course a reaction to Imperial Japan's attempt to secure for itself the "Faustian" resources the author decries. 

Additionally, it's "the West" that reveres older buildings, something that's not really a thing in Japan, at least for residential buildings.

*Update, Fri 31 March 2023:* the young man in question has a lot of... questionable sources and ideas, but I'll cut him some slack for being, well, young, and also quite sheltered. Hopefully he reads someone other than Oswald Spengler, Hackernews, and Reddit.

They're only defeated by a string of terraforming comets routed through a wormhole from a solar system many lightyears away smashing into the planet.

*Newton's Wake* -- the amoral Carlyle crime family, rising to prominence on Earth in the ruins of a hard takeoff singularity, employ (or enslave, in his opinion) a digital construct of one of the nerds who engineered the singularity. He's found in orbit around a red dwarf, according to the narrator as punishment by his ascended self for being so insufferable.

--- 

"How to be a good human" has been an open question since the dawn of civilization. Many systems have been proposed, none have become universal. 

The current crop of AI doomsters are a good example of the old joke that for some people it's easier to imagine the end of the world than imagine the end of capitalism. The vision they espouse (Bostrom) is of an endless expansion into the universe, converting all matter into substrates for running simulations of quadrillion upon qaudrillions of humans doing -- what? Shopping, I guess. Oh, and fucking.

One can only imagine their horror if the provably benevolent AI overlord decrees that the best way to preserve humanity is to reduce the population to, say, 10 million globally and ensure this population lives in harmony with the biosphere until the sun becomes a red giant. Or if the way to reach the stars is simply Communism. After all, the signals provided by the Market can trivially be simulated by a superintelligent AI, who will decree who works with what and how much their labor is worth. Any opposition to the Grand Project of Mankind Reaching the Stars will be dispassionately eliminated.

In both these cases AI has preserved humanity, but at an intolerable cost to the right-libertarians currently cosplaying as humanity's saviors.

### Why I believe Russia was behind the Nord Stream pipeline explosions

(from [this HN thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35742067))

* disabling Nord Stream I gets Gazprom off the hook for failing to deliver gas to customers in Europe through *force majeure*
* Leaving one pipeline of Nord Stream II intact left a door open for Germany to get gas in exchange for ending support for Ukraine
* it's a not so subtle message to Nato that Russia sees the Baltic as their lake, and underwater resources are not safe
* planting disinformation about "who really did the deed" was used to sow discord among the de facto allies of Ukraine.

Twitter sometimes still throws up good stuff as it slowly drowns in a pool of its own effluent. Best stuff now is a menswear historian who patiently dismantles tradfash narratives about how to dress AS A MAN.

> Det var i mars som paret, en man och en kvinna, blockerade polisen när de försökte få stopp på en förare av en personbil. Mannen körde bland annat ut med en hjullastare framför polisbilen när den kom körandes i en hög hastighet, som ledde till att patrullen tvingades väja ner i diket.

> Jakten slutade med att föraren av personbilen kom undan. Polisen misstänkte att paret blockerade vägen eftersom föraren de försökte stanna var deras son. Polisen har dock inte kunnat styrka att det var sonen som körde personbilen.

### Compact Flash, he dead

I did a deep dive into what the <strike>cool kids</strike> old fogeys are using in their expensive NiCany cameras these days, and it's basically game over for the ole CF card. 

[Originally posted on lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/s/uovahy/version_2_my_solar_powered_epaper_digital#c_rwtd31)

The last "prosumer" DSLR from Nikon (the D850) has SecureDigital (SD) and XQD slots. 

The pro D5 has one Compact Flash slot and one XQD slot. 

The Z9 (pro mirrorless) has has CFexpress and XQD. The corresponding Canon model, the R3, has CFexpress and SD slots.

The Sony Alpha 9 has dual SD slots.

#### What the hell is "XQD" and "CFExpress" you say??

Quoting [El Wik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XQD_card)

> [XQD] cards are not backward compatible with CompactFlash or CFast cards [...]. XQD and CFast were both designed as a replacement of the 1994 CompactFlash standard.

> The format was first announced in November 2010 by SanDisk, Sony and Nikon, and was immediately picked up by the CompactFlash Association for development. The final specification was announced in December 2011.

> On 7 September 2016 the CFA announced the successor of XQD, CFexpress. This new standard uses the same form-factor and interface but uses the NVMe protocol for higher speeds, lower latencies and lower power consumption.

Raoul Moat was a violent criminal who killed his ex-partner's new boyfriend and seriously injured her in a fit of jealous rage after being released from prison. He killed himself after the biggest manhunt in UK history. Weirdly he became a sort of folk hero online. The show takes the police's side of things, while not portraying the press as depraved immoral attention hounds which is the usual in UK TV.

Aussie thriller about a man, his wife, and their nanny. Is she mentally ill? Is he gaslighting her? Who is sleeping with whom?

Spoilers:

---

It's the dude. He's messing with his wife's meds to force her to break down mentally, so he can get custody of the kids togehter with the nanny, who he is banging. Why he couldn't just divorce her is left unsaid (he's a big-shot lawyer). Why they had to move to Australia for this to work (with the nanny following, even though the couple met in London) is also unclear. Why the wife gets the support of a kindly gay cab driver is unknown, unless the actor is a beloved institution in Oz. The show is produced by the Neighbors team, after all.

> Heck, 20+ years is enough time to educate, train, hire and surgically insert an entire generation of people into key positions in the policy arena specifically to accomplish this one goal like sleeper cell agents. Likely much, much, easier than training highly qualified alignment researchers.

At MIRI, we don't do things because they are easy. We don't do things because we are grifters.

> Didn't we pretty much always know it was going to come from one or a few giant companies or research labs? Didn't we understand how those systems function in the real world? Capitalist incentives, Moats, Regulatory Capture, Mundane utility, and International Coordination problems are not new.

This is how they look at all other problems in the world, and it's fucking exasperating. Climate change? I would simply implement 'Capitalist Incentives'. Wealth inequality? Have you tried a 'Moat'? Racism? It sounds like a job for 'Regulatory Capture'. Yes, all problems are easily solvable with 200 IQ and buzzwords. All problems except the hardest problem in the world, preventing Skynet from being invented. Ignore all those other problems; someone will 'Mundane Utility' them away. For now, we need your tithe; we're definitely going to use it for 'International Coordination', by which I totally don't mean buying piles of meth and cocaine for our orgies.

> The researches of Sir John Herschel and M. Pouillet have informed us of the annual expenditure of the sun as regards heat ; and by an easy calculation we ascertain the precise amount of the expenditure which falls to the share of our planet. Out of 2300 million parts of light and heat the earth receives one. The whole heat emitted by the sun in a minute would be competent to boil 12,000 millions of cubic miles of ice- cold water. How is this enormous loss made good? Whence is the sun’s heat derived, and by what means is it maintained? No combustion, no chemical affinity with which we are acquainted would be competent to produce the temperature of the sun’s surface. Besides, were the sun a burning body merely, its light and heat would assuredly speedily come to an end.

> On 14 August, a separate team, at the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research in Stuttgart, Germany, reported synthesizing pure, single crystals of LK-99. Unlike previous synthesis attempts that relied on crucibles, the researchers used a technique called floating zone crystal growth that allowed them to avoid introducing sulfur into the reaction, eliminating the Cu<sub>2</sub>S impurities.

> The result was a transparent purple crystal — pure LK-99, or Pb<sub>8.8</sub>Cu<sub>1.2</sub>P<sub>6</sub>O<sub>25</sub>. Separated from impurities, LK-99 is not a superconductor, but an insulator with a resistance in the millions of ohms — too high to run a standard conductivity test. It shows minor ferromagnetism and diamagnetism, but not enough for even partial levitation. “We therefore rule out the presence of superconductivity,” the team concluded.

### Re: Arguments against the metric system

[Trawling through my drafts, I came upon this [old entry from May 2022](https://gerikson.com/m/2022/05/index.html#2022-05-25_wednesday_02) and decided to exhume an old Gemini post. It was originally posted on 2022-05-26.]

Context, [this post about the disadvantages of the metric system](https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/degrowther.smol.pub/20220525_anti_metric).

---

> [...] I dislike many of the arguments people use to push for its broader adoption in the US.

I don't think this article makes a coherent argument, and I'll try to spell out why.

> I am a scientist and also have training as an engineer. I love measuring things! But in many cases, measurement doesn’t serve us — it serves the needs of the state and capital. It’s no coincidence that the push to adopt an international system of measures coincided with the ascension of capitalist hegemony. 

Societies before the current capitalist orders have measured. Measurement is central to everything from construction, to trade, to medicine... Every society benefits from accurate, reproducible measurements. Even in the future non-capitalist utopia, we still need measurements to ensure clean water, medicine, and the daily allowance of <strike>gruel</strike> nutricious energy slurry.

> Being measured is the first step that a mere object takes toward becoming a commodity. Objects are useful for people, but commodities are only useful for capitalists (I just saved you the trouble of reading about three chapters of Marx).

It's almost as if the largest system of chattel slavery in the world preceded the introduction of the metric system, and survived for six decades afterwards.

Likewise, the foundations of the greatest colonial empire in history were layed just before the French Revolution.

> Adoption of the metric system does not free its user from the limitations of the squishy organic matter that’s using those measurements. Why else would centimeters be such a commonly used measure, when the metric system supposedly prefers multiples of 1000 (and 0.001), if something on the scale of an inch isn’t inherently useful? 

No it doesn't, and no-one has said it would. SI is not normative in that way. 

During history, coherent systems based on the meter have included [cgs][cgs] (centimetre-gramme-second), [MTS][MTS] (metre-tonne-second), and the ultimate victor, MKS-A (meter-kilogram-second-Ampere).

Of course people adopt measurements that are "closest" to what they want to measure. We use *centi*meters for stuff like boxes, *milli*meters for small stuff, *deci*liters for food-related volumes, *hecto*liters for wine production, *hect*ares for land area, *kilo*meters for distance. So in each case, the meter is subdivided or extended into terms that fit the measurement domain.

In Sweden a common measurement is the "mil", or 10km. It's often used when discussing longer distances. 

Implying SI demands only the use of powers of ten that are modulo 3 is a strawman. 

Both [inches][inches] in use in the USA (industrial/statute and survey) are based on the meter, but with slightly different definitions.

When should a user measuring small distances in customary units go from say, 1/64″ to 15.625 thousands?

> The metric system was invented by one of the first modern nation-states, then a brand new liberal democracy that didn’t let its new commitment to the notions of individual freedom from expanding upon the cruel colonial policies of its former monarchy. 

This wildly misrepresents the political realities of the French Republic, which abolished slavery.

The largest, most widespread *colonial* empire was ruled from a country that used those nice, human-based __imperial__ measurements. 

#### Update Sunday, 2022-05-29

[UK Metrication timeline](https://ukma.org.uk/press/metrication-timeline/) 

> 1861 - A committee of the British Association for Advancement of Science (BAAS) including William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin), James Clerk Maxwell and James Prescott Joule introduced the concept of a coherent system of units which is fundamental to the modern metric system. They proposed the metre, gram and second as base units.

> 1963 - Weights and Measures Act redefined the basic measures of the ‘yard’ and the ‘pound’ in terms of the ‘metre’ and the ‘kilogram’. Many of the old imperial measures were abolished (drachm, scruple, minim, chaldron, quarter, rod, pole, perch, and a few more). Imperial units are now defined in terms of metric.

### 🇷🇺  Oderint dum metuant

[Originally written on 12 May 2022.]

This saying, attributed to Caligula, can be translated as "let them hate, as long as they fear". It is a good summary of the current Russian "imperial project", such as it is. There does not seem to be any benefit to being ruled by Russia, apart from an abstract belonging to the Russian empire. No benefits accrue to even parts of the conquered. The material fruits of labor will be confiscated. The weak will be harassed and violated. The conquered culture will be replaced by Russian culture, by the point of the bayonet and the strike of the MLRS. 

Is it strange that people outside Russia fear and hate Russian domination?

Historical empires offered a *quid pro quo*. Submit  to Rome and enjoy the fruits of the Roman peace. Elites were welcomed to join Roman society. Roman troops kept trade safe. Citizens were Roman citizens, free from arbitrary prosecution.

The British empire grew from the pursuit of profit, but it found plenty of local collaborators in the areas it razed for lucre. These populations profited too, and exchanged local control for silver and safety. 

The current *pax Americana* is among the lightest of yokes. The US rules by proxy, by the dollar, and by the NYSE. Adhere to the rules and get very, very rich, and send your children to be educated in the finest universities on Earth. 

What does Russia offer? A desert, and not even peace.

#### It didn't have to be like this

Russia could have remained integrated in the world economy. Its elites could have continued selling fossil fuels on the world market, while keeping its middle class happy with Western consumer goods. Its intelligence service could continue to warp Western democracies using the judo trick of "free speech" to poison public discourse, all hidden behind plausible deniability. 

In a brighter future, eager pupils would flock to Pushkin Institutes worldwide to learn Russian, to drink from the deep wells of its culture, to visit and move there, all while Russians could take advantage and move where they wanted, learning, sending money home, letting other meet them as human beings, and returning home richer, for all to benefit.

It would not be a zero-sum game. Russia would be a place of wonder, not of fear.

No one wants to be hated, only a few want to be feared. To be feared and hated, and reviled, is the worst fate of all.

Oh he's not a billionaire, obviously he is Of The Left. 

(I quickly googled this dude of whom  I have never heard and didn't find any obvious techfash red flags, but maybe he's better at hiding them than most others)

Anyway, extropianism!

> like all arguments from first principles, the Extropians encountered problems when trying to extrapolate derivative principles, like political economy.

"OK so *right now* it's basically fascist feudalism, but it *could be* socialism", got it.

More weird framings

> But some effective altruists, most famously the crypto scammer and donor to the Democratic Party Sam Bankman-Fried,

Outside the "not all EAs!" crowd I haven't seen this before,  but the authors are "democratic socialists" which basically means they hate the Democrats more than the GOP.

I can kinda agree on their take on Cosmism, which AFAIK is really fringe (I mean, *I* have heard of Fyodorov, but I have read a lot of SF), but even here they can't really refrain from oohing over the "weird and wonderful" Russian cosmists, while perfunctorily noting that they're all fascists now. 

> Russian Cosmists also prefigured a version of eco-philosophy, emphasizing the unity of all living beings and the interconnectedness of the universe. Cosmists believed that all forms of life, including animals and plants, were part of a universal whole. They advocated for the ethical treatment of all living creatures and the preservation of biodiversity.

> The Izborsky Club explicitly condemns the technocratic “transhumanism” of Western thought, including individualism, rationalism, democracy, capitalism and transgender rights, as contrary to their “technocratic traditionalist” Cosmism. The Izborsky Club reflects the swirl of NazBol ideas in contemporary Russia, attempting to merge Russian Orthodoxy, Bolshevik authoritarianism and fascist “Eurasian” racial-nationalism.  [....] In other words actual organized Russian Cosmists today despise TESCREAL ideas and their Western proponents.

But both Musk and Thiel hate trans people, but trans treatment is essentially transhumanism, how can we square this circle? It is a mystery. 

---

There has to be a middle way between "omg we are all doomed" (which has been a trope since at least WW2, imho) and "don't worry if the planet boils, as long as a hostile AI doesn't kill us all humanity will be fine". And you know? I'm hopeful that if we can get our act somewhat together we can pull through. 

But it's **transparently clear** that TESCREAL ideology is an attempt to 
coopt bright young minds into dreaming about life [fucking and shopping in outer space](https://gerikson.com/m/2023/04/index.html#2023-04-30_sunday_01) instead of getting mad and taking action against the old men who have led us down this dark path.

### A legal ban on LLM content harvesting?

I stated this as a throwaway in [a comment on lobster.rs][c_fhob3x]

> I’d prefer a legally enforced method to ban LLM providers from ingesting my content.

Another user asked me to explain via a message on the site, this is my reply, expanded:

---

So, I doubt a legal solution is… possible, because LLM content ingestion is cleverly contained within the space of fair use. There’s very little distinction between Google indexing my site and enabling searching for it, and OpenAI from doing the same and translating the text into a multidimensional matrix.

One is useful to me, as it presents my words to a wider audience. One is not useful to me, because it enables someone to take my words and cadence and reproduce it without attribution.

My main gripe with generative AI is that it devalues labor. Now, I'm a simple country blogger, but this affects educators, technical writers, copywriters, scriptwriters... not to mention the people working in visual arts. Sure, there's a lot of semantically valueless prose out there, and generative LLMs might make creating such prose easier, but to what end? Isn't it better to get rid of it altogether, instead of teaching machines how to emulate it?

LLMs are *nothing* without human input. LLM companies launder the work of millions of humans, and pay thousands of classifiers a pittance, to generate a profit presenting a simalucrum of human creativity. Remove the inputs and the models spiral into uselessness. 

If nothing else, I’d like to be able to charge a nominal fee for providing my work as input to LLMs. Maybe a law requiring payment is enough to make the entire thing uneconomical, without dismantling existing copyright law.

### adventures in anchoring

Part of the design of this blog is having a flow of posts, ordered by month. Within each month there are days, and there can be multiple entries per day. As the ideal is that a post can be just a sentence, or a word, having the traditional format of one page == one post, surrounded by a ton of side fluff like titles, navigation etc. felt excessive.

So the model is one big page, with entries identified by HTML anchors. 

The anchor targets (`id`) were originally part of the `<article>` element, which makes semantic sense. However, these anchors don't work in text mode browser (specifically `w3m`). 

I stumbled upon the W3C validator, and it stated that an article element has to have a title. In a fit of pique I added a semantically null empty `<h3>` element, and attached the anchor to it. This turns out to enable nav in w3m. but added a lot of extra whitespace. 

In the end I figured I didn't want to have an empty h3 tag so I replaced it with a `<p>` with an anchor. This seems to work ok so I'll go with it from now.

### car worship, an anecdote

At my first year at uni in the early 90s, we had a course in the "History of Science and Technology", which was pass/fail, and you just had to attend a certain number of lectures. I found it quite interesting but most of my fellow students were there for the engineering courses and didn't really like the softer side of the course.

One day, the lecturer made the mistake of stating what is now obvious, that increasing the number of lanes on a highway does not reduce congestion in the medium term - it just increases traffic. Stockholm was in the throes of a debate regarding a road traffic expansion project, and many of my fellow students were from the more affluent suburbs that this project was meant to serve.

Man, if people were sleepy before, they weren't now. Spotty kids just out of high school and who probably didn't have a driver's license could vehemently recite the pro-highway arguments down the smallest talking point. Any restrictions in the free flow of automobiles was seen as rank heresy. And we weren't even studying civil engineering, so where they'd picked up the prediliction of hugging cement (*betongkramare*) was beyond me.

Anyway, just thought about that for some reason. ⛐

### John W. Campbell Jr. -- cryptofascist

> [Moorcock said that] Campbell's Stories and its writers were "wild-eyed paternalists to a man, fierce anti-socialists" with "[stories] full of crew-cut wisecracking, cigar-chewing, competent guys (like Campbell's image of himself)", who had success because their "work reflected the deep-seated conservatism of the majority of their readers, who saw a Bolshevik menace in every union meeting". He viewed Campbell as turning the magazine into a vessel for right-wing politics, "by the early 1950s ... a crypto-fascist deeply philistine magazine pretending to intellectualism and offering idealistic kids an 'alternative' that was, of course, no alternative at all".

> Bester commented: "[my conversation with Campbell] reinforced my private opinion that a majority of the science-fiction crowd, despite their brilliance, were missing their marbles."

The same show episode as one of the protagonists reacting to a TV news segment of people wearing protective gear on public transport with "this is the sort of news that gets people killed". Now it's possible they were reacting to a previously reported rumor that a Latina food truck was responsible, but the juxtaposition was a bit jarring.

(Show is *Chigaco Med* S05E04 "Infection: Part II")

JWZ on *The Wheel of Time*: 

> An important reminder is that *The Witcher* and *The Wheel of Time* are actually two different shows! They are both an incoherent mess set in an identical thousand-year-long Sixteenth Century With Elves and Portals and Chosen Ones, and incomprehensible politics that drain any of the fun out of the ass kicking, but one of them has.... actually I don't know. Something must distinguish them but I don't know what. Good luck with that. Watching this show is like that time I was two hours into *Heat* before I remembered that Al Pacino and Robert De Niro are completely separate people.

A good SF show. It's interesting that it seems that animation can spend more time exploring the actual story and ramifications of a SF scenario than live action can.

One example of this is that the trope of "going public" is treated realistically. Instead of being the resolution to a story, like so many movies, in this case it doesn't resolve the situation at all. Demagogues and those in power handle it, and the public reacts with conspiracy theories.

%

> To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand SlateStarCodex. The <strike>racism</strike>philosophy is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of rhetoric most of the points will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Scott’s rationalist outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Eliezer Yudkowsky’s self-insert fanfic, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these points, to realise that they’re not just trite- they say something deep about SOCIETY. As a consequence people who dislike SlateStarCodex truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the value of Scott’s upholding of the “principle of charity”, which itself is a cryptic reference to <strike>not punching Nazis</strike>neoreaction. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Scott Alexander’s genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

> And yes, by the way, i DO have a MIRI tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

### Why is Hacker News considered a "hivemind"?

Often online you will encounter the meme[1] that [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com), nominally a link discussion site,  is a "hivemind". There are no individual commentators, only one single organism, denoted HN, or hackernews. 

There are a few reasons for why people experience this.

HN is __HUGE__. In my dataset, there are 3.04M submitted links. The top 20 submitters have submitted 7% of those - 217.6k. The most discussed stories have over 3,000 comments. Unlike in smaller forums, it's hard to stand out, even if you're a prolific commenter. 

HN usernames are de-emphazised in the UI. They are the same size and color as comment metadata (time posted, score etc).[2] There are no profile images. Names are generally in lowercase, and there's no culture of "jokey" usernames, like on Reddit, where sometimes the contrast between a juvenile penis-themed username and real knowledge leads to recognition. 

There's no "push" notification to a commenter of a reply. If you want to see who has replied to your comment, you need to actively visit the "threads" page, where the threads you have participated in are presented (generally starting with your comment). These leads to a very common phenomenon of one person commenting, another answering, and a third person answering *as if they were the first*. Not in the sense of impersonation, but implicitly aligning themselves to the first person's viewpoint. Sometimes this is a straight answer to the second person's question, but very often it's the third party arguing like (they think) the first party would.

HN culture frowns on jokiness and humor. See the point about usernames above. Pithy replies are often downvoted, along with blatantly incorrect and offensive ones. Because HN karma has some value (if you have above a certain amount you can flag articles etc) this naturally leads to a certain conformity of tone, further reinforcing the hivemind impression.

[2] There are exceptions, very new usernames are green instead of grey.

> In fact, this is reality if we just remove the "AI" and replace it with "capitalism".

### Advent of Code 2023: one week in

The consensus online seems to be that the 2023 edition of Advent of Code is harder than previous years. Does the data bear this out? 

This table shows the leaderboard completion times[1] for the years 2020 to 2023. I chose 2020 as a cutoff as 2019 was a bit of an outlier (it was the year of `intcode`, where a custom language was used in many problems), and I believe that AoC really became nerd mainstream in 2020.

The shortest and longest completion times are marked in green and orange.

*Saturdays* and <u>Sundays</u> are denoted in italic and underline, respectively. These days are often when more difficult problems are posted.

Studying this table, we can only see one outlier: 2023D05. At 26m37s it's almost twice as difficult as any other problem before 2023. 

In other words, the evidence does not bear out the hypothesis that the first 7 days of AoC 2023 is uniquely difficult.

If you want to do your own analysis, you can use the commands [here](https://github.com/gustafe/aoc2023/blob/main/get-time-stats.md) or download the data (up to 2022) [here](https://github.com/gustafe/aoc2023/blob/main/AoC-leaderboard-times-2015-2022.txt).

### No red port left in the cupboard

This is the last bottle I owned of 1960 Souza Guedes port wine:

<blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="a/pqFffJk" data-context="false" ><a href="//imgur.com/a/pqFffJk">no red port left in the cupboard</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I received these bottles in batches after my 21st birthday. My dad had bought a case when I was born, and didn't really predict the precipitous decline of port wine drinking among everyone, not just young people. But in time I met some people who were prepared to drink port after dinner, and a few memorable evenings were spent with it. 

At its best it was like drinking liquid chocolate.

The bottles have not all been stored ideally, and this last one had a slightly dried cork which plopped down into the bottle when I tried to pull it out. It was still drinkable though, but not as good as it could be.

I'm grateful I've had the opportunity to share these bottles with so many different people. Thanks, dad!
