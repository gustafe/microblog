Få se om Liberalerna säljer sig för 30 silverpenningar, eller om SD lyckas förhandla ner dom till 25 och etniskt segregerade friskolor.

### Jean-Luc Godard RIP

To be honest I was surprised he was still alive.

### [Blessed Be Thy Nuclear Weapons: The Rise of Russian Nuclear Orthodoxy][russia-orthodoxy-nukes]

[russia-orthodoxy-nukes]: https://warontherocks.com/2019/06/blessed-be-thy-nuclear-weapons-the-rise-of-russian-nuclear-orthodoxy/

> Adamsky’s book covers two distinct but equally fascinating processes that have taken place in post-Soviet Russia: the church’s integration into the nuclear-military complex and the political system’s parallel quest to engineer a national idea, lend itself legitimacy, and rebuild the power of the state that crumbled when the Soviet Union collapsed. Russian Orthodoxy is thus a decidedly secular concept, a mechanical replacement part for the many bits of machinery – or in Russian parlance “political technology” – that broke during the nation’s failed attempt at democracy in the 1990s. The church, an institution with ambitions of its own, volunteered to participate in Russia’s time-honored tradition of restoring state power after collapse, and expanding it to dominate society. At its heart, Russian nuclear orthodoxy constitutes the collective belief that to preserve its Orthodox character, Russia must be a nuclear power, and to guarantee its nuclear status, Russia must be genuinely Orthodox.
