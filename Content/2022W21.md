There may be nuggets of precious metal submerged in the offal that fills places like LessWrong but I for one am not inclined to sift it to find them.

### systemd.path vs make

I used to build this blog on demand using a simple make recipe, but I've long wanted to move it to being built if a file is changed. 

Inspired by [this post](https://me.rbel.co/posts/lists-sh-hacks/)[1], I managed to get it going, with some trial and error. 

Specifically, in addition to running the command 

    systemctl --user enable microblog.{path,service}

I also had to run 
	
    systemctl --user start microblog.path 

The entire process (9.8k entries) takes around 3s. I'm pondering "optimizing" it but don't know if it's worth it.

[1] that post pertains to <https://lists.sh>, which is an interesting service if you're into list-based microblogging.

### RIP my permalinks

I implemented a better format for the permalink fragments based on the post title. So if you have bookmarked anything, sucks to be you. Also the feeds might go crazy. Sorry.

I'm happy I quit interacting with Gemini  before I read this [tripe][metric], otherwise I would have been compelled to respond to it.

Also LOL at this HN comment<sup>\*</sup>

> Money, more than anything is an amplifier, and it has amplified a neuro-atypical man with an unbalanced ego and actual political opinions you might not agree with. He is a real person with massive accomplishments who has enough money to firmly grab the wheel on the ship of our country, not some cardboard cutout of good or evil.

And that's what's scary about Fusk.

2022-05-29 Taking a break

I've decided to take a break from social media, IRC, and sites like lobste.rs and Reddit. 

My incessant tweeting and chatting was getting in the way of <strike>Elden Ring</strike> my actual work. 

More seriously, the current state of the world is increasingly getting me down, and social media isn't helping. I'm not giving up, but I need to refocus my energies in more positive directions.

This blog will still be updated but I'll try to cut down on the snark and negativity.
