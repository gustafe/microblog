"If you can get past the racism and pr0n, you'll learn a lot about LLMs there" is not the ringing endorsement of 4chan as a Reddit alternative HN seems to think it is.

### Proggit gone private, and the future of Reddit integration on HN&&LO

[HN&&LO](https://gerikson.com/hnlo/) was throwing errors so I figured it was the Reddit API finally coming to an end. I started ripping out the code, then realized it was was just [proggit](https://reddit.com/r/programming/) set to private.

Anyway I never really liked the Proggit integration, I don't follow the sub, I don't know its values. If Reddit lets us keep API access and you feel you like to have Proggit be part of HN&&LO, let me know. Otherwise I'll just remove it.

### RIP Oysttyer

Oysttyer, *née* TTYtter, the excellent terminal client for Twitter is no more. The API key no longer works, presumably because of Twitter's boneheaded changes. Well it was a good run, I've been using it since at least 2009. 

If only there was something as good and reliable for fedi....

Just waiting for Reddit to replace mods in the striking subreddits with the very worst of the site's users as scabs.

Case in point, HN bootlickers are on board:

> I agree with Reddit on this one. Like it or not, Reddit is a private company! Moderators are abusing their power and holding communities as a hostage. Reasons why they do it are irrelevant! Next hot issue will be global warming, elections or whatever.

> Guy takes over company because he’s positive that there are awful things happening behind the scenes. Gives “full access” to a bunch of very ignorant journalists who are confused about what they find. Guy who now owns the company falsely insists that they proved what he believed all along, leading to the revival of a preternaturally stupid lawsuit… only to have the company’s lawyers basically tell the judge “ignore our stupid fucking owner, he can’t read or understand any of this.”
