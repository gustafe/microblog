### tea time

I used to be quite particular about how I took my tea (lapsang souchong with milk, I know it's heresy but I was young) but my family hated the smell of lapsang and I started to drink more coffee. So now I use bags, and generic black "English Breakfast" tea.

Teabags used to annoy me because the little tab didn't really fit into the compost recycling. Enter PG Tips which don't have a tab and are cheap. 

I'm trying to be better at steeping the tea longer.

Writing your own static site generator is this generation of programmer's variant of writing your own IRC client.

### almost 20 years of static site publishing

My first blog was a home-grown bash script (long since lost in the mists of time).

Then I blogged using Movable Type, which infamously combines the heft of DB backing with the high latency of static.

Then I ran blosxom dynamically for a while, until the overhead of generating (poorly implemented) Markdown bogged it down. So I used its static publishing option (around 2007). 

This blog is more trad SSG.
