I had a reason to reference this [post](https://gerikson.com/m/2024/02/index.html#d27p01_tue) in a comment elsewhere, and came up with the following summary:

#### The declining returns of AI promises

* AI is superintelligence (SFnal tropes like HAL 9000)
* AI will make knowledge workers obsolete (the promise of "expert systems")
* AI will replace human vehicle operators 
* AI will replace paralegals and coders 
* AI has made illustrators, stock photographers and spam email copywriters redundant (←&nbsp;we are here)
* for $10/month, you will be able to emulate the average Reddit poster (←&nbsp;the glorious apotheosis)

### THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND 

In the wake of the [xz debacle][ars-xz], there's been a weird reaction among some FLOSS[1] supporters. Some of them are advocating for intrusive and frankly problematic changes to how projects should accept contributions. Among them are enforcing "real name" or even ID requirements, and what would require FLOSS teams to essentially become HR departments.

Note, that this is to control people who donate their time to produce software that is provided free of cost to anyone. 

It's as if some people feel the "FLOSS community", loosely defined, has to "step up" and "take responsibility" for the quality of their software. Despite almost every project having some variant of the title of this post (from the MIT license) that clearly states that if you use the software, it's on you. 

Are these people afraid that if they don't provide these assurances, the huge corporations who are now happily using their software would stop providing them with zero compensation for their labor, and start using some other software that does? It's like racing to the bottom, when you're already there. 

There are legitimate reasons to critically discuss the ways in which the xz attackers gained access to a software repository, and how they managed to hide malicious code within what looked like innocuous test data. But those discussions should be focused on the internal needs of the FLOSS community. If they happen to coincide with the needs of companies using this software for free, so much the better. 

For *consumers* of FLOSS, how about not relying on the kindness and integrity of literal strangers on the internet? Maybe set up something [Underwriter's Laboratories][wiki-ul], where you can pool resources for security experts to scrutinize the code your company relies on but doesn't pay for. Naturally, any flaws this organization finds will be fixed and given back to all. 

(This post is an expansion on [my comment on lobste.rs][c_ezont0].)

See also: [The XZ Utils backdoor is a symptom of a larger problem][ariadne-xz]

> [...] when we take software from the commons, we are like raccoons digging through a dumpster to find something useful. There is no “supply chain” in reality, *but* there is an effort by corporations which consume software from the commons to pretend there is one in order to shift the obligations related to ingesting third-party code away from themselves and to the original authors and maintainers of the code they are using.

So he did the whole media circuit, wrote a book, etc. Was this an abuse of attorney-client privilege?

Not sure of the total lack of coverage of the latest crazy anti-EU party in Sweden on the fediverse is good or bad.

For people who might care:

* the person who registered the party was thrown out as MEP of the local christian democrat party for first advocating for weed legalization, then playing footsie with the local populist ex-nazi party to "keep her job"
* but wait! The first person on the list isn't her, it's a previous reality show winner, ex-social democrat, millionaire from building refugee housing, and probably a patron of brothels. He sounds like a dime-store Trump
* the party has 6 other people on the list, but who they are is a mystery for now
* the party's website seemed to have been llm-generated, with bizarre mispellings and denoting existing MEP's as "traitors"

Journos here are ecstatic, at last something fun is happening with the EU elections! Some are really hoping \#swexit will be a thing, but realistically the only people interested in voting for these clowns are the ones already voting for the EU-skeptic "ex-nazi" party.

I don't want to be the person who tells a tilde admin to do their jobs, but I feel that for the effort put into developing [bunkchat](https://git.bunk.computer/bunk/bunkchat#bunkchat) it would have been more effective setting up a common IRC config for all new users and running a local IRC server. That way you have a one-stop journey to group chat ("run this command to launch an IRC client and connect to a common channel") with the added option to actually use IRC, which I think is a big draw of tilde servers.
