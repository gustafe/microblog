#### [🔗 Ed Zitron: OpenAI Is A Bad Business](https://www.wheresyoured.at/oai-business/)

I swear I had not read this before opining on lobste.rs this morning: 

<https://lobste.rs/s/92qcme/insatiable_hunger_open_ai#c_vgiyrk>

> The AI bubble is gonna run headlong into real economic issues. Unlike the previous dominant target of equity funding, social networks, powerplants and datacenters are hard infrastructure that need to be paid upfront, utilizing scarce knowledge workers (planners, skilled contractors etc) that will be in sudden demand all at once. This all has to be paid for, and I guess OpenAI etc are planning for previous cable TV penetration - i.e. most households in the US will be happy to pay ~$500/mo for LLM access. Maybe a big company will plan to pay twice their current SaaS spend __iff__ GenAI actually delivers on its productivity promise.

> Will this be enough to cover the cost of projects that have historically been the province of state funding (power plants)? Will there be enough money in household budgets to cover GenAI access if the power bill doubles or triples because OpenAI can spend investor money on power? What about the opportunity cost of a startup with actual benefit to humanity not being able to cover its power needs?

&#x1F1F8;&#x1F1EA; [någon på SVT](https://www.svt.se/nyheter/utrikes/biden-om-orkanen-milton-evakuera-nu-nu-nu) vet inte riktigt hur [Saffir-Simpson-skalan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson_scale) fungerar: 

> Milton nedgraderades från en kategori 5-orkan till en kategori 4-orkan natten mot tisdagen, lokal tid. Orkanen uppgraderas sedan tillbaka till en kategori 5-orkan.

> Trots det varnar myndigheter för att orkanen kan orsaka översvämningar och därmed bli livshotande. 

En kategori-4 orkan har max ihållande vindhastiget på mellan 58 och 70 m/s. Den [högst uppmätta vindhastigheten i Sverige var 51,8 m/s](https://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/vasterbotten/fastslaget-nytt-svenskt-vindrekord-i-stekenjokk-gar-inte-att-fatta-fruktansvart) (dvs på nedre gränsen av vad en __kategori-3__ orkan kan uppnå). 

*uppdatering* efter att ha klantat till indata till bloggen fick jag av en slump en länk om orkaner med __kategori-6__. Då faller hela meningen med Saffir-Simpson. 

<https://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2024/02/category-6>

*uppdatering efter att stormen dragit in* det "bidde bara" en kategori-1 till slut, men det rapporteras om flera döda, upp till 3 miljoner människor utan el, och antagligen kommer dom totala skadorna uppgå till flera miljarder dollar.

It’s amusing that GenAI hawkers have transformed programming from creative problem solving to code reviewing the output of an amnesiac corgi dog and are surprised programmers aren’t happy. Programmers famously love to review code!

It's depressingly clear that a significant number of Americans don't see Hitler's rise to power in 1933 as a warning, but as a blueprint. 

*edit* good thing I run my own blog so I don't get banned for mentioning Hitler, unlike [people on Threads](https://www.techdirt.com/2024/11/01/threads-bans-anyone-for-mentioning-hitler-even-to-criticize/)

> You (group A) think C is simple, that it can be thought of as portable assembly, that it teaches you how computers actually work, and that it’s easy to avoid memory safety errors with good programming discipline, and is therefore fine.

> You (group B) think C is deceptively complex, is far removed from current-day real world hardware semantics, abstracts memory in an outdated and overly simplified manner, and that it’s very hard for even professionals to write programs that are correct to the extent of equivalent programs in memory safe languages, therefore C shouldn’t be use for new software development.

You don't know, so don't say you do --  
You don't.  
You might think that things will change,  
But take my word,  
They won't  
You paint a lovely picture,  
But reality intrudes  
With a message for you  
And it's real bad news

Season 2 of a previously acclaimed show is hard. Season 1 had a compelling mix of contempory crime and historical injustices, with a specific focus on British policing's use of undercover infiltrators.

In season 2 they're trying for a *Happy Valley* vibe. Hardscrabble communities struggle with crime, but the criminals have their own code! It's a confusing mess that doesn't make sense.
