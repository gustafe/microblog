#### [üîó Ed Zitron: OpenAI Is A Bad Business](https://www.wheresyoured.at/oai-business/)

I swear I had not read this before opining on lobste.rs this morning: 

<https://lobste.rs/s/92qcme/insatiable_hunger_open_ai#c_vgiyrk>

> The AI bubble is gonna run headlong into real economic issues. Unlike the previous dominant target of equity funding, social networks, powerplants and datacenters are hard infrastructure that need to be paid upfront, utilizing scarce knowledge workers (planners, skilled contractors etc) that will be in sudden demand all at once. This all has to be paid for, and I guess OpenAI etc are planning for previous cable TV penetration - i.e. most households in the US will be happy to pay ~$500/mo for LLM access. Maybe a big company will plan to pay twice their current SaaS spend __iff__ GenAI actually delivers on its productivity promise.

> Will this be enough to cover the cost of projects that have historically been the province of state funding (power plants)? Will there be enough money in household budgets to cover GenAI access if the power bill doubles or triples because OpenAI can spend investor money on power? What about the opportunity cost of a startup with actual benefit to humanity not being able to cover its power needs?

&#x1F1F8;&#x1F1EA; [n√•gon p√• SVT](https://www.svt.se/nyheter/utrikes/biden-om-orkanen-milton-evakuera-nu-nu-nu) vet inte riktigt hur [Saffir-Simpson-skalan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson_scale) fungerar: 

> Milton nedgraderades fr√•n en kategori 5-orkan till en kategori 4-orkan natten mot tisdagen, lokal tid. Orkanen uppgraderas sedan tillbaka till en kategori 5-orkan.

> Trots det varnar myndigheter f√∂r att orkanen kan orsaka √∂versv√§mningar och d√§rmed bli livshotande. 

En kategori-4 orkan har max ih√•llande vindhastiget p√• mellan 58 och 70 m/s. Den [h√∂gst uppm√§tta vindhastigheten i Sverige var 51,8 m/s](https://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/vasterbotten/fastslaget-nytt-svenskt-vindrekord-i-stekenjokk-gar-inte-att-fatta-fruktansvart) (dvs p√• nedre gr√§nsen av vad en __kategori-3__ orkan kan uppn√•). 

*uppdatering* efter att ha klantat till indata till bloggen fick jag av en slump en l√§nk om orkaner med __kategori-6__. D√• faller hela meningen med Saffir-Simpson. 

<https://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2024/02/category-6>

*uppdatering efter att stormen dragit in* det "bidde bara" en kategori-1 till slut, men det rapporteras om flera d√∂da, upp till 3 miljoner m√§nniskor utan el, och antagligen kommer dom totala skadorna uppg√• till flera miljarder dollar.

It's depressingly clear that a significant number of Americans don't see Hitler's rise to power in 1933 as a warning, but as a blueprint. 

*edit* good thing I run my own blog so I don't get banned for mentioning Hitler, unlike [people on Threads](https://www.techdirt.com/2024/11/01/threads-bans-anyone-for-mentioning-hitler-even-to-criticize/)

> You (group A) think C is simple, that it can be thought of as portable assembly, that it teaches you how computers actually work, and that it‚Äôs easy to avoid memory safety errors with good programming discipline, and is therefore fine.

> You (group B) think C is deceptively complex, is far removed from current-day real world hardware semantics, abstracts memory in an outdated and overly simplified manner, and that it‚Äôs very hard for even professionals to write programs that are correct to the extent of equivalent programs in memory safe languages, therefore C shouldn‚Äôt be use for new software development.

You don't know, so don't say you do --  
You don't.  
You might think that things will change,  
But take my word,  
They won't  
You paint a lovely picture,  
But reality intrudes  
With a message for you  
And it's real bad news

Season 2 of a previously acclaimed show is hard. Season 1 had a compelling mix of contempory crime and historical injustices, with a specific focus on British policing's use of undercover infiltrators.

In season 2 they're trying for a *Happy Valley* vibe. Hardscrabble communities struggle with crime, but the criminals have their own code! It's a confusing mess that doesn't make sense.
