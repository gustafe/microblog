The way Goodreads tries to gamify reading is depressing.

Remember last week, when we had room temperature superconductors and aliens? Good times.

The first four seasons of this British police procedural show are superlative. Great characters, good storylines, and, importantly, the plots are grounded in (as far as I can tell) realism. Unfortunately the short fifth season feels like a cash grab where everyone carries the idiot ball. Avoid if you like this show.
