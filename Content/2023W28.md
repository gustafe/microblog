#### [ðŸ“º Lie With Me/With Intent](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14521436/)

Aussie thriller about a man, his wife, and their nanny. Is she mentally ill? Is he gaslighting her? Who is sleeping with whom?

Spoilers:

It's the dude. He's messing with his wife's meds to force her to break down mentally, so he can get custody of the kids togehter with the nanny, who he is banging. Why he couldn't just divorce her is left unsaid (he's a big-shot lawyer). Why they had to move to Australia for this to work (with the nanny following, even though the couple met in London) is also unclear. Why the wife gets the support of a kindly gay cab driver is unknown, unless the actor is a beloved institution in Oz. The show is produced by the Neighbors team, after all.
