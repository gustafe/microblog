News of a massive earthquake in Turkey. I hope Sweden sends what help it can to assist in search and rescue. 

*Update* we are prepared to assist if requested. 

*Update 2* it looks really really bad, with aftershocks registering above 7 on the Richter scale. I have my own beef with the continued use of Richter scale values in media but that's for another time.

Internet nerds who make fun of people anthropomorphizing their pets unironically anthropomorphizing large scale learning systems.

Unconfirmed reports of heartless idiots on social media saying we shouldn't help Turkey with earthquake relief if they don't let us into NATO. Do these idiots know what being a NATO member means? It means helping countries like Turkey if they're attacked. If we don't help now with a humanitarian disaster, why should Turkey trust us to help in a military alliance?
