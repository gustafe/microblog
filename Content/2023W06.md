News of a massive earthquake in Turkey. I hope Sweden sends what help it can to assist in search and rescue. 

*Update* we are prepared to assist if requested. 

*Update 2* it looks really really bad, with aftershocks registering above 7 on the Richter scale. I have my own beef with the continued use of Richter scale values in media but that's for another time.
