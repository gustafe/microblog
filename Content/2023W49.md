### Advent of Code 2023: one week in

The consensus online seems to be that the 2023 edition of Advent of Code is harder than previous years. Does the data bear this out? 

This table shows the leaderboard completion times[1] for the years 2020 to 2023. I chose 2020 as a cutoff as 2019 was a bit of an outlier (it was the year of `intcode`, where a custom language was used in many problems), and I believe that AoC really became nerd mainstream in 2020.

The shortest and longest completion times are marked in green and orange.

*Saturdays* and <u>Sundays</u> are denoted in italic and underline, respectively. These days are often when more difficult problems are posted.

Studying this table, we can only see one outlier: 2023D05. At 26m37s it's almost twice as difficult as any other problem before 2023. 

In other words, the evidence does not bear out the hypothesis that the first 7 days of AoC 2023 is uniquely difficult.

If you want to do your own analysis, you can use the commands [here](https://github.com/gustafe/aoc2023/blob/main/get-time-stats.md) or download the data (up to 2022) [here](https://github.com/gustafe/aoc2023/blob/main/AoC-leaderboard-times-2015-2022.txt).

[1] This is the time it takes for the first 100 complete solutions to be posted. After that the solutions megathread on the subreddit is unlocked. 

As the leaderboard competitors consist of the most dedicated and experienced participants, this time is a good measure of a problem's difficulty.

\#gaming Slipping back into Fallout 4 like a pair of well-worn slippers... so comfy... the exploration / looting / crafting loop is smooth.

I'm following ManyATrueNerd's playthrough of Sim Settlements, but it's not something that really attracts me. Besides I have like *one* achievement left to 100% the game, and a mod would disable that.
