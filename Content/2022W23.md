> In reality it's more complicated. An intellectual with zero knowledge of humanities is nearly guaranteed to fall in love with the first theory he becomes acquainted of. That's why all those Soviet (and post-Soviet) STEM folk are such an easy prey for charlatans. Saw it many times

> Many Westerners think that Russians are into mysticism. As a general rule, that's wrong. (Smart) Russians don't fall for mysticism that easily as Westerners could imagine. What Russians really fall for easily and enthusiastically is pseudo science

Making slow progress in Elden Ring. I was quite proud of defeating the final boss in the Raya Lucaria Crystal Tunnels first try, with about half health and no FP (no flasks either).

More progress in Elden Ring - I've moved over to a greatsword (Lordsworn's) from straight sword, and I've taken down 2 ulcerated tree spirits and a Night's cavalry. Feeling more confident about tackling new areas - banking runes before a difficult run, not fretting over losing a couple thou if something goes sideways.

Someone who has either never used Usenet or has very selective memories of its heyday asks HN about it. Refreshingly, many people have decent takes on this so-called "Golden Age" of the Internet.

Usenet was full of crap, but the Great Filter of history has removed it leaving only the carefully polished gems behind.

Also it was incredibly male and white. That's partly why I view retro-nostalgic efforts like Gemini with some skepticism. Their ideal is far too easily conflated with elitism.

This comment is probably the best of the bunch (I don't vouch for the commenter nor their other content):
