&#x1F1F8;&#x1F1EA; vilket exakt brott anser Assange att Nobelstiftelsen begått? Det vore bra om någon i svensk media tog reda på det istället för att bara upprepa Wikileaks pressrelease.

#### [Wikipedia: Papal Tiara (*Triregnum*)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_tiara)

> Pope Paul VI was crowned with a tiara at the papal coronation. As happened sometimes with previous popes, a new tiara was used, donated by the city of Milan, where he was archbishop before his election. [...] Near the end of the third session of the Second Vatican Council in 1964, Paul VI descended the steps of the papal throne in St. Peter's Basilica and ascended to the altar, on which he laid the tiara as a sign of the renunciation of human glory and power in keeping with the renewed spirit of the council. It was announced that the tiara would be sold and the money obtained would be given to charity.
