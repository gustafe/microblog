I can't believe Felon tried to solve UKR vs. RUS and got ratio'd to hell. Funniest thing today, and god knows I needed it.

He blamed bots, of course. What a tool.

HN stans are like "what if he withdrew Starlink eh? Better be nice to papa Elon".

> One aspect of all the "The West should seek peace before Russia uses nukes" is that NATO isn't fighting here: the whole conceit is denying Ukraine agency, which plays into Russian prejudices.

Tänkte skriva att det svenska politiska etablissemanget inte är redo för en troll av Fallenkvists kaliber men det var den visst (hennes uppdrag på SD Riks är "pausad"). 

Det är ju inte 100% säkert att regeringsalternativet vinner i riksdagen. SD behöver *inte* en debatt om huruvida Anne Frank förtjänade att dödas för att hon var "liderlig" just den här helgen.

#### [In defence of the indefensible][christy-ussher]

[christy-ussher]: https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2009/10/25/in-defence-of-the-indefensible/

> Friday was the 23rd of October [2009] and the Internet sceptics had a field day mocking one of their favourite punching bags James Ussher (1581 – 1656) Archbishop of Armagh. Ussher is notorious for dating the creation of the world to 6 pm on the 22nd of October 4004 BCE (and not 9 am on 23rd October as Pharyngula falsely stated) a fact that the hordes of Pharyngula and other similar self appointed defenders of scientism love to brandish as a proof of the stupidity of Christians.

> For various reasons Ussher chose the autumnal equinox and placed the moment of creation on the beginning of the Sunday preceding the 4004 BC equinox, 25th October, that he had determined using Kepler’s Rudolphine Tables. He chose the Sunday as the first day of creation because the Bible says that the creation took six days and God rested on the seventh, which is the Jewish Sabbath, the Saturday. The point of creation is 6pm on Saturday the 22nd October because in the Jewish calendar the new day starts at 6 pm. All of this is within the social and cultural norms of his times perfectly sensible and rational and only appears idiotic when viewed from our perspective. Ussher was not the fool that he is presented as being by the modern sceptics but a highly regarded scholar of his times.
