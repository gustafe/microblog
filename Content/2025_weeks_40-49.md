My newly issued Dell work lappy is the same size as my Macbook Air M1 but somehow manages to feel both chunkier *and* more cramped. Also Win11 sux

2025-11-11 Armistice Day

A war widow is technically single so the rebranding of Armistice Day to Singles Day is not totally off base... also happy Independence Day to Poland! 🇵🇱

> A very telling detail in all this, as some comic has been pointing out, is that Trump, who mispronounces words in general and peoples’ names in particular constantly, always pronounces “Ghislaine” correctly, even though he doesn’t know her at all.

#### [🔗🐪 John Bokma: ISO week and year in Perl](http://johnbokma.com/blog/2019/09/04/iso-week-and-year-in-perl.html)

Shorter: `%G` is the `strftime` code for the ISO week year.

Yesterday I asked the following of the Fediverse: 

--- 

App recommendation requested. 

Basically, I want to be able to track, for each working day, 2 bits of info: whether I travelled by car or public transport. (this is for tax reporting purposes)

Ideally I’d have a week view and checkboxes for each day, but freeform text works too. 

Must be able to export data. 

iOS preferred, web service works too. 

The search space for this is incredibly polluted. 

---

I got a few reccos, but ultimately I settled for a variation of the [basic idea outlined here](https://terokarvinen.com/2021/calendar-txt/), which is a plain-text file with one day per row. I modified the output to only include working days and added a header with the week number. 

Code is [here](https://github.com/gustafe/weekdaystemplate)

Sandifer believes, like I do, that there's something ineffable about consciousness . I fully believe that simulating this stuff is fundamentally impossible. Sometimes it feels like everyone forgot that chaos theory was a thing.

> [...]  perhaps we can move toward a Hegelian or even Zizekian synthesis, in which stupid people create epistemological bubbles, and epistemological bubbles create stupid people, in a sort of grand enstupidization of the circle of life.

vague premonition that the Audi/VAG servers have sh\*t the bed this morning - can't contact the car to get it to warm up \#firstworldproblems

*Update 2025-11-30* I figured it was a "privacy protection" issue, which I have had problems with before, and was resigned to "deep reset" the car when it randomly started working again. Never change, Audi.
