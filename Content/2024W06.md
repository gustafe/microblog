I haven't heard Luke Comb's cover of Tracey Chapman's *Fast Car* much, but it appeared on radio the other day and I was struck by its faithfulness to the original, as well as a queasy feeling that it was a younger white man ripping off the work of an older Black woman. But according to this piece, I've misread it totally.

Bruce Sterling predicted Category 6 storms decades ago in *Heavy Weather*: [Category 6][lgm-cat6]

> Right now, every hurricane with maximum sustained wind speeds above 156 miles an hour is considered a Category 5 on the [Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale][saffir-simpson]â€”whether itâ€™s blowing 160 mph, like Hurricane Ian, or roughly 215 mph, like Hurricane Patricia, which struck Mexico in 2015. To distinguish between extreme storms and, well, extremely extreme storms, James Kossin, a distinguished science adviser at the climate nonprofit First Street Foundation, and Michael Wehner, a senior scientist studying extreme weather events at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, explored adding a hypothetical sixth step to the scale. Category 6 hurricanes, they write, would encompass winds above 192 miles an hour. By their definition, five hurricanesâ€”all of which occurred in about the previous decadeâ€”would have been classified as Category 6.
