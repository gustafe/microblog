I haven't heard Luke Comb's cover of Tracey Chapman's *Fast Car* much, but it appeared on radio the other day and I was struck by its faithfulness to the original, as well as a queasy feeling that it was a younger white man ripping off the work of an older Black woman. But according to this piece, I've misread it totally.

Bruce Sterling predicted Category 6 storms decades ago in *Heavy Weather*: [Category 6][lgm-cat6]

> Right now, every hurricane with maximum sustained wind speeds above 156 miles an hour is considered a Category 5 on the [Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale][saffir-simpson]â€”whether itâ€™s blowing 160 mph, like Hurricane Ian, or roughly 215 mph, like Hurricane Patricia, which struck Mexico in 2015. To distinguish between extreme storms and, well, extremely extreme storms, James Kossin, a distinguished science adviser at the climate nonprofit First Street Foundation, and Michael Wehner, a senior scientist studying extreme weather events at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, explored adding a hypothetical sixth step to the scale. Category 6 hurricanes, they write, would encompass winds above 192 miles an hour. By their definition, five hurricanesâ€”all of which occurred in about the previous decadeâ€”would have been classified as Category 6.

The [Ember][ember-store] "smart mug" sure missed a trick by not using Java. On the other hand, that could have led to the mugs being used in a [botnet][toothbotnet]. On the third hand, there's probably only a couple of hundred mugs around. 

It's a dumb product.

#### [ðŸ”— Review: Chris Dixon's *Read Write Own*][mollywhite-dixon]

Delicious evisceration. This book doesn't deserve the attention.

&#x1F1F8;&#x1F1EA; *VÃ¥r tid Ã¤r nu* prickar mÃ¥nga historiska turer rÃ¤tt, men att vÃ¤nsterterroristen John (i sÃ¤song 3) skulle finna en fristad i Spanien 1971 Ã¤r inte en av dom. 

Och Ethel som jobbar tills hon Ã¤r typ 90 Ã¤r ju heller inte sÃ¤rkilt sannolikt.

So in the space of less than a decade we have had 

* Gemini the buttcoin exchange, run by the Winklevii, currently in big economic trouble
* Gemini the smol web protocol, beavering (gophering?) away, not really setting the world on fire
* Gemini the Google LLM rebrand, which will soon go away once parent company is distracted by the shiny (what iteration of chat services are they up to now?)

I'm excited what next idiocy this term will be attached to.
