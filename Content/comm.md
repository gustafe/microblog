2007-04-11 Battle of the nanoblogs

So no sooner have I been sucked into the Twitter-verse but I found out
about [Jaiku](http://jaiku.com) which sometimes feels like a knockoff
but arguably has more features.

They have a [S60 client](http://jaiku.com/mobile) in beta, which
compares favourably for me to Twitter's SMS-only posting. On the other
hand, Twitter's IM posting is mighty convenient. Jaiku hasn't got one yet.

As of now, it's easier to post to Twitter and have Jaiku pick up the
comments via RSS (see [this
post](http://www.techlifeweb.com/2007/04/how-to-cross-post-from-twitter-to-jaiku.html)
for a good description). The reverse is not true, as you cannot easily grab
RSS feeds from Twitter. However, there are workarounds. [Jim Hughes
writes about one
here](http://feetup.org/blog/blogging/Jaiku-to-Twitter.html).

And that's not even mentioning yet another nano-blogging service,
[Loopnote](http://loopnote.com/).

For now, I'm going to stick with Twitter but use Jaiku as a feed
aggregator for stuff like Flickr and del.icio.us. If you wanna stalk me Web 2.0 style, grab the feed from [gerikson.jaiku.com](http://gerikson.jaiku.com/).

May the best time-wasting service win!

2007-07-20 Facebook wishlist

I've gotten sucked into [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/), and so far it looks like it has the right mix of stringentness and openness to make a succesful social network.

Stringentness in that there's a good deal of reciprocity in who you add as friends, and openness in that you can hook other stuff in (Twitter, last.fm, Flickr etc.)

I'd like the following:

* RSS feeds for notifications ([Frank](http://www.gadgetguy.de/) tells me that it exists, but if I can't find it after looking for 30 seconds, it might as well not exist...)
* some sort of IM integration. Twitter is great in that way. 

Basically I'd like to interact to web apps in 2 ways: via RSS (Bloglines) and IM (gtalk, 'cos it's the least closed system.) Visting a new web page isn't really gonna do it for me. And email notifications? Please, it's 2007. Keep email for the squares, let us young one's get stuff the new way!

2005-04-17 Gmail and mailing lists

I've re-subscribed to the [Gunroom](http://www.hmssurprise.org/) after
a long hiatus, and I'm using [gmail](http://gmail.google.com) instead
of `gnus` this time. So far, I'm pleasantly surprised by the
experience. Google have done a lot of work making the user interface
easy to use, even with high volumes of mail.

Things I like about it:

* Keyboard shortcuts makes it easy to navigate. Extra points for being
  `vi`-like.

* Intelligent threading. Older mails are "stacked" in a pile, making
  it easy to see where in the conversation you are.

* Quoting is handled very well. Quoted text is folded so you don't
  see it all the time.

* Good handling of contacts, with autocompletion of names.

* Drafts are saved in the position from where they would have been
  sent if they weren't drafts.

Things that could be better:

* <strike>I'd like to be able to choose whether to place my text underneath the text of the email I'm replying to.</strike>

* <strike>The default display and composition font (Arial) sucks. I prefer monospaced fonts for email. Maybe you can handle this with Greasemonkey</strike>

*Update 2008-01-11:* the above issues have been fixed! See [this post](http://gustaf.symbiandiaries.com/weblog/comm/Bottom-posting-in-Gmail.html) for details. Still no monospaced font for composition though...

All in all, I'm impressed with gmail. Web-based interfaces are just
getting better and better, with gmail, [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com)
and [Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com) leading the mail.

2004-12-08 Ineffective email

[Jeremy Zawodny on what's wrong with email](http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/003192.html). 

I'm glad he wrote it so I don't have to.

This quote shall henceforce be my personal credo:

> If you leave it up to *me* to figure out exactly what you mean, I'm
  always going to choose the one I most like.

*Update:* [This article
shows](http://news.com.com/What+corporate+America+cant+build+a+sentence/2100-1030_3-5481494.html
"email illiteracy at American companies") that the
problem is worse than just top-posting. 

> An entire educational industry has developed to offer remedial
  writing instruction to adults, with hundreds of public and private
  universities, for-profit schools and freelance teachers offering
  evening classes as well as workshops, video and online courses in
  business and technical writing.

Isn't this a pretty bad grade for the American school system?

Finally:

> "E-mail has just erupted like a weed, and instead of considering
  what to say when they write, people now just let thoughts drool out
  onto the screen," Hogan said. "It has companies at their wits' end."

How true.

2007-10-02 Narcissism leaderboard

[Nick Carr](http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2007/10/sic_transit_glo.php):

> The technology blogosphere is like a giant dog that is forever
  chasing its tail - except when it stops to lick its netherparts.

This quote captures the fizzy nothingness that is the [Techmeme
Leaderboard](http://www.techmeme.com/lb) perfectly.

[Owen
Thomas](http://valleywag.com/tech/stats/techmeme-starts-tracking-the-valleys-self+obsession-305809.php):

> By ranking blogs on links, not traffic, it reinforces the founding
  myth of Technorati: It's not who reads you, it's who blogs you that
  matters. And by limiting itself to tech blogs, Techmeme confirms
  most tech bloggers' sheltered worldview. Why pay attention to the
  world outside, or cater to mainstream readers' interests? The only
  people worth caring about are the ones already on your blogroll.

Predictably, [Dave
Winer](http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/10/01/niceToBe1AtSomething.html)
wants to track the changes to the leaderboard somehow:

> A pragmatic question for people who want to follow the TechMeme
  LeaderBoard -- it's clearly not practical to look at it as
  frequently as it could change, every 20 minutes.
>
> So what kind of tool do we need to tell us about change? Email
  notification? An RSS feed for each site? I'm interested in knowing
  what people think.

For god's sake, *let it go*. 

*Update 2007-10-06:* [Dave fell out of love fast this time](http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/10/04/techmemeIsOfficiallyACessp.html).

2005-10-04 Phun phishing

Det verkar som om Nordeas kunder utsattes för en phishing-attack
igår. Enligt en av det "drabbade" så var sajten imponerande, men
brevet inte lika välkomponerat:

> L&auml;gg m&auml;rke till!

> Extraf&ouml;rnyelse av elektronbetalingars s&auml;kerhetssystem!!

> &Auml;rade kunder av InternetBank NORDEA. Vi l&aring;tar komma Ers
  k&auml;nnedom de senaste nyheter om v&aring;r bankens
  s&auml;kerhetssystem.

> Banken Nordea insisterar p&aring; det bindande f&ouml;rfarande att
  genomg&aring; den upprepade autentifisering, f&ouml;r att f&aring;
  er personalinformation &ouml;verf&ouml;rt s&aring; fort som
  m&ouml;jligt p&aring; den nya, mera s&auml;ker server av v&aring;r
  banken.

> F&ouml;r att f&aring; ert kontots normal funktions fortg&aring;ng,
  beh&ouml;var ni ing&aring; i ert konto p&aring; den nya server, som
  &auml;r skyddad, med utnyttjande av era diskontdata; i motsatt fall
  skall ert Internet konto blockeras provisoriskt under 24 timmar
  f&ouml;r er s&auml;kerhet f&ouml;r
  tillg&aring;ngarsbortf&ouml;rande, f&ouml;r att undg&aring;
  "Phishing"\'s attackers stora antal, som stiger st&auml;ndigt.

Man skulle kunna tro att detta inte skulle lett till några som helst
napp för bedragarna, men medierna slog upp detta stort.

[Expressen](http://expressen.se/index.jsp?a=446390) verkar utgå från
att alla är korkade:

> Joakim Eberlund, 29, fr&aring;n Malm&ouml; reagerade direkt n&auml;r
  han fick mejlet klockan 21.56 i g&aring;r kv&auml;ll.

> -- Jag jobbar med e-postsystem s&aring; jag m&auml;rkte ganska snart
  att n&aring;got inte st&auml;mde, annars hade mitt konto varit
  t&ouml;mt nu. Det &auml;r mycket oroande, s&auml;ger han.

Ähem, jag jobbar inte med e-postsystem, men jag hade reagerat direkt jag med, eftersom jag skulle utgå från att Nordea skulle anställa någon som kan svenska för att skicka ett sådant mail...

[Aftonbladet](http://aftonbladet.se/vss/nyheter/story/0,2789,708222,00.html)
är något mer balanserad. Samma Johan framställs där inte som ett lallande fån:

> Joakim Eberlund i Malm&ouml;, kund i banken, fick mejlet, men anade
  att n&aring;got inte stod r&auml;tt till:

> -- Men jag &auml;r &ouml;vertygad om att andra kunder kan ha lurats
  av detta. Hade exempelvis min pappa haft Nordea skulle jag ha ringt
  och varnat honom f&ouml;r att absolut inte g&aring; in p&aring; den
  falska hemsidan, s&auml;ger han.

Jag försökte förgäves se vad DN hade att säga om det hela, men sajten
var nere när jag kollade (10:50).

2004-12-06 The Playlist Meme

1. Open up the music player on your computer.

2. Set it to play your entire music collection.

3. Hit the "shuffle" command.

4. Tell us the title of the next ten songs that show up (with their
   musicians), no matter how embarrassing. That's right, no skipping
   that Carpenters tune that will totally destroy your hip
   credibility. It's time for total musical honesty. Write it up in
   your blog or journal and link back to at least a couple of the
   other sites where you saw this.

5. If you get the same artist twice, you may skip the second (or
   third, or etc.) occurances. You don't have to, but since randomness
   could mean you end up with a list of ten song with five artists,
   you can if you'd like.

This is my list:

* Kelly Clarkson, *Walk Away*
* Ragnarok, *Et Vinterland i Nord* 
* Suzanne Vega, *Those Whole Girls*
* Badly Drawn Boy, *Take The Glory*
* Suzanne Vega, *The Queen and the Soldier*
* Lars Demian, *Det manliga beteendet*
* Stiff Little Fingers, *At The Edge*
* Julie Roberts, *Pot of Gold*
* Avril Lavigne, *Forgotten*
* Curve, *Doppelganger*

2007-07-04 "Unlocking" the iPhone

There's a lot of hot air in the States about "unlocking" the iPhone. For me, and for everyone else in Europe, unlocking  means getting the device to work with an operator other than AT&T. 

However, the [recent](http://nanocr.eu/2007/07/03/iphone-without-att/) [efforts](http://iphone.fiveforty.net/wiki) are concerned with *crippling* the phone, by providing invalid data to the activation process so that you can use the music player and WiFi, but not GSM voice and data.

You're essentially getting a [$600 iPod Nano with WiFi and a touchscreen](http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/blog/blogView?showComments=true&printTitle=An_Oversized,_expensive_Nano&entry=3361004109). Yawn. Wake me up when we get some real unlocking.

What this illustrates is the chasm between Apple's image and AT&T's. People are somehow convinced that AT&T subtracts value from the device, sullying the pureness of Apple's vision. I think AT&T needs to think long and hard about how they got into this position, and what they can do to get out.

*Update 2007-07-05:* [this article](http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/RDM.Tech.Q3.07/3D7F6BE5-9749-4E41-848D-523BEA6F660F.html) has a pretty good overview about what's involved in unlocking the iPhone.

2004-11-27 We Yahoo!

Yes, we do! [Russ](http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/) was just
going on and on about how cool Yahoo Messenger was, so everyone
downloaded it, logged in, added one another to their address books in
wild abandon, dug up old and cruddy webcams and sat [looking at other
people looking at
them](http://www.thauvin.net/blog/news.jsp?date=2004-11-26#929).

The weird thing was that we were still on #mobitopia, using the video
an unbelievably bandwidth-intensive backchannel.

After a while we got together for a voice sessions, stretching the
bandwidth limits to the max. Don't know if it'll work when the US
isn't celebrating Thanksgiving. Waves to Russ (San Fransisco), Frank
(Germany), Anthony (Hawaii), and Tarek (UAE).

I don't know if IM will be the new mode of communication for me
personally. I like the group chat nature of IRC, where you can fade in
and out of conversations as your interest in them wanes or waxes. PM
and rarely-used channels can be used for one-on-one conversations. In
IM, one-on-one is the norm.

*Update:* I got [linklove from
Russ](http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008181.html). I must say
I agree with him about the lack of an automatic group chat. A well-run
IRC channel (my experience of these is limited to #mobitopia, so I
could be arguing from a really limited data set here) is a like a nice
pub or a university common room. Sometimes there are people to talk
to. Sometimes they're there, but reading a paper or chatting with
someone else. Entering a channel is like opening a door. It signals
the fact that you're there, and other people can acknowledge you
directly or talk to you later.

In contrast, IM is like someone calling you on the phone while you're
at home working. Granted, you can leave a message on your machine, or
simply not answer some calls, but it's still an interruption.

For some people and situations, IM is really great. For me however, I
don't think it's the thing. I prefer to interact with others either
asynchronously via email, or loosely coupled, via IRC. 

However, setting up an IRC network (even if this is just a channel and
some users) is a way bigger hassle than using a well designed IM
system like Yahoo's or MSN's. They take care of the hassle for you,
and you accept the compromise or do your own thing. I happen to
believe that the group dynamics of the
[Mobitopia](http://www.mobitopia.com/) blog/channel would have been
hard to create with just IM. But ultimately, it's not technology that
creates groups and ideas, but people. IM is simply another tool.

*P.S.* How much would you bet on a Google IM network? It would be
interesting, but then the realization would dawn that Google is just
Yahoo! v.2...
