> By now, you’ve used generative AI — either out of curiosity, or because a tech company forced it upon you, as Google did with its insipid AI overviews. Since you’re reading this newsletter, I wager you believe as I do: that generative AI is inherently shit and it can’t do what its proponents claim.

> One thing, at least, that Trump is proving is how ridiculous is the neoliberal claim, championed by the likes of Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek, that somehow a set of laws that protect private property, especially if it is concentrated in a few hands, would be able to protect individual liberty against tyranny.
