### tea time

I used to be quite particular about how I took my tea (lapsang souchong with milk, I know it's heresy but I was young) but my family hated the smell of lapsang and I started to drink more coffee. So now I use bags, and generic black "English Breakfast" tea.

Teabags used to annoy me because the little tab didn't really fit into the compost recycling. Enter PG Tips which don't have a tab and are cheap. 

I'm trying to be better at steeping the tea longer.

### almost 20 years of static site publishing

My first blog was a home-grown bash script (long since lost in the mists of time).

Then I blogged using Movable Type, which infamously combines the heft of DB backing with the high latency of static.

Then I ran blosxom dynamically for a while, until the overhead of generating (poorly implemented) Markdown bogged it down. So I used its static publishing option (around 2007). 

This blog is more trad SSG.

It's ironic to see TV shows set before the pandemic dealing with infectious diseases where the producers still can't put the beautiful cast members behind masks, so they're running around breathing in the bad stuff all the time, then visiting uninfected people and spreading the infection. Except they don't, because they have plot armor. 

The same show episode as one of the protagonists reacting to a TV news segment of people wearing protective gear on public transport with "this is the sort of news that gets people killed". Now it's possible they were reacting to a previously reported rumor that a Latina food truck was responsible, but the juxtaposition was a bit jarring.

JWZ on *The Wheel of Time*: 

> An important reminder is that *The Witcher* and *The Wheel of Time* are actually two different shows! They are both an incoherent mess set in an identical thousand-year-long Sixteenth Century With Elves and Portals and Chosen Ones, and incomprehensible politics that drain any of the fun out of the ass kicking, but one of them has.... actually I don't know. Something must distinguish them but I don't know what. Good luck with that. Watching this show is like that time I was two hours into *Heat* before I remembered that Al Pacino and Robert De Niro are completely separate people.

A good SF show. It's interesting that it seems that animation can spend more time exploring the actual story and ramifications of a SF scenario than live action can.

One example of this is that the trope of "going public" is treated realistically. Instead of being the resolution to a story, like so many movies, in this case it doesn't resolve the situation at all. Demagogues and those in power handle it, and the public reacts with conspiracy theories. 

Season 2... *goes places*.

> To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand SlateStarCodex. The <strike>racism</strike>philosophy is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of rhetoric most of the points will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Scott’s rationalist outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Eliezer Yudkowsky’s self-insert fanfic, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these points, to realise that they’re not just trite- they say something deep about SOCIETY. As a consequence people who dislike SlateStarCodex truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the value of Scott’s upholding of the “principle of charity”, which itself is a cryptic reference to <strike>not punching Nazis</strike>neoreaction. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Scott Alexander’s genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

> And yes, by the way, i DO have a MIRI tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎
