With all Drew respect to the ambitions of making Hare a 100-year language, I'd let a couple of years pass before passing judgement. The creator has a history of enthusiastically embracing stuff only to drop it later -- see gemini.

It's ironic to see TV shows set before the pandemic dealing with infectious diseases where the producers still can't put the beautiful cast members behind masks, so they're running around breathing in the bad stuff all the time, then visiting uninfected people and spreading the infection. Except they don't, because they have plot armor. 

The same show episode as one of the protagonists reacting to a TV news segment of people wearing protective gear on public transport with "this is the sort of news that gets people killed". Now it's possible they were reacting to a previously reported rumor that a Latina food truck was responsible, but the juxtaposition was a bit jarring.

(Show is *Chigaco Med* S05E04 "Infection: Part II")

JWZ on *The Wheel of Time*: 

> An important reminder is that *The Witcher* and *The Wheel of Time* are actually two different shows! They are both an incoherent mess set in an identical thousand-year-long Sixteenth Century With Elves and Portals and Chosen Ones, and incomprehensible politics that drain any of the fun out of the ass kicking, but one of them has.... actually I don't know. Something must distinguish them but I don't know what. Good luck with that. Watching this show is like that time I was two hours into *Heat* before I remembered that Al Pacino and Robert De Niro are completely separate people.
