Surprised to see an unwelcome nick pop up on Lobste.rs. Submitted entry correctly flagged as spam. Perusing person's blog reveals they're still paranoid, perhaps clinically, and any prospective contributors to their project should keep that in mind.

Nice to see the usual red color of the lobste.rs logo replaced with the rainbow. Now if only the tooltip would say the current gayness level of the site instead of how busy it is ;)

Gmail didn't break email. Spammers (abusing the open nature of email) broke it long ago, and gmail/outlook.com are just the reaction to trying to protect a vital resource from being drowned in garbage.

I'm sorry your rosy ideals of open protocols have run into the harsh reality of bad actors fucking with said protocols.

### Some TV from the UK 🇬🇧

#### [📺 The Hunt for Raoul Moat](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt19788754/)

Raoul Moat was a violent criminal who killed his ex-partner's new boyfriend and seriously injured her in a fit of jealous rage after being released from prison. He killed himself after the biggest manhunt in UK history. Weirdly he became a sort of folk hero online. The show takes the police's side of things, while not portraying the press as depraved immoral attention hounds which is the usual in UK TV.

(SVT streaming, 3 eps)

#### [📺 Cheaters SE01](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt17501750/)

A fun show about 4 people in their own relationships, two of whom cheat with the other while on a trip. Turns out they are neighbors! Dramedy ensues. 

Ends on a cliffhanger.

(SVT streaming)

Sometimes I wonder if part of the tech community just uses the term "decentralized" as a shibboleth, whithout more deeply regarding the term's meaning.

In retrospect it was a bad idea for me to pontificate about the failure of the Fediverse the same day Twitter's owner decided to take a chainsaw to the face.
