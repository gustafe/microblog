### Markdown rocks

I don't care what the haters say, Markdown is awesome.

Here's some whiner complaining about the lack of 

> admonitions, figures, definition lists, citing blockquotes, footnotes, table of contents

With the exception of figures (which the blog engine I based this on fixes) I have zero need of any of that stuff. And if I did I'd create a couple of Emacs macros to insert the required HTML.

I guess that feature list is part of AsciiDoc, and AD dead-enders are salty their favorite lightweight markup language lost. Boo hoo. Create a popular blog engine that support AD instead of whining that others only support MD.

Interesting essay by Charles Stross. Namechecks [Linda Nagata][linda-nagata] and [Ken MacLeod][ken-macleod], as well as the brilliant [Lena][lena-story].

### Wasted time()

In more places than I care to count in my Perl code, I've wanted to output the current time and/or date.

The way I've done it is by using the built-in function `localtime` (or its UTC variant `gmtime`). From the [manual][localtime-manual]:

> Converts a time as returned by the time function to a 9-element list with the time analyzed for the local time zone. Typically used as follows:

```
#     0    1    2     3     4    5     6     7     8
my ($sec,$min,$hour,$mday,$mon,$year,$wday,$yday,$isdst) =
                                            localtime(time);
```

So what I'd do, depending on what I'd want, was to copy the above definition into my code, then output (say) a ISO 8601 time like so:

```
printf("%04d-%02d-%02dT%02d:%02d:%02d\n", $year+1900, $mon+1, $mday, $hour, $min, $sec);
```

TEDIOUS

So what I found out *last month* was [`Time::Piece`][time-piece].

This provides an OO wrapper to `localtime` and friends, so the above code becomes 

```
my $t=localtime;
say $t->datetime;
```

And the kicker? It's been around since... 2001.

Reached level 90 tonight, got Death's Poker. The demi-human mob summons are my new best friends. I'm doing good work with Great Stars and Lion's Claw, the Lordsworn's Greatsword with Flame of the Redmanes, and finally Magma Wyrm's Scalesword, which rocks.

#### The White Queues of Dover

BBC: [Dover traffic: Port declares critical incident over long queues](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-kent-62263176)

> __French__ border controls have been blamed for the delays of up to six hours.

(my emphasis)

One persistent irritant of Brexit boosters is the idea that their actions won't have any consequences to *them*. They want border controls for people *entering* Britain, but it works both ways - and it's weird to demand that France, a country Brexiteers hate and fear, should spend public funds to alleviate their entirely self-inflicted problems.
