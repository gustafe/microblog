An interesting take on hosted microblogs: <https://prose.sh>

Of course I prefer to roll my own but if you're not a hacker like me this might be a good choice ðŸ˜‰

### Markdown rocks

I don't care what the haters say, Markdown is awesome.

Here's some whiner complaining about the lack of 

> admonitions, figures, definition lists, citing blockquotes, footnotes, table of contents

With the exception of figures (which the blog engine I based this on fixes) I have zero need of any of that stuff. And if I did I'd create a couple of Emacs macros to insert the required HTML.

I guess that feature list is part of AsciiDoc, and AD dead-enders are salty their favorite lightweight markup language lost. Boo hoo. Create a popular blog engine that support AD instead of whining that others only support MD.

### [Crimes against Transhumanity][stross-crimes]

Interesting essay by Charles Stross. Namechecks [Linda Nagata][linda-nagata] and [Ken MacLeod][ken-macleod], as well as the brilliant [Lena][lena-story].

As usual don't read [the comments][hn-stross-crimes].

### Wasted time()

In more places than I care to count in my Perl code, I've wanted to output the current time and/or date.

The way I've done it is by using the built-in function `localtime` (or its UTC variant `gmtime`). From the [manual][localtime-manual]:

> Converts a time as returned by the time function to a 9-element list with the time analyzed for the local time zone. Typically used as follows:

```
#     0    1    2     3     4    5     6     7     8
my ($sec,$min,$hour,$mday,$mon,$year,$wday,$yday,$isdst) =
                                            localtime(time);
```

So what I'd do, depending on what I'd want, was to copy the above definition into my code, then output a ISO 8601 time like so:

```
printf("%04d-%02d-%02dT%02d:%02d:%02d\n", $year+1900, $mon+1, $mday, $hour, $min, $sec);
```

TEDIOUS

So what I found out *last month* was [`Time::Piece`][time-piece].

This provides an OO wrapper to `localtime` and friends, so the above code becomes 

```
my $t=localtime;
say $t->datetime;
```

And the kicker? It's been around since... 2001.
