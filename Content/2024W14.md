### THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND 

In the wake of the [xz debacle][ars-xz], there's been a weird reaction among some FLOSS[1] supporters. Some of them are advocating for intrusive and frankly problematic changes to how projects should accept contributions. Among them are enforcing "real name" or even ID requirements, and what would require FLOSS teams to essentially become HR departments.

Note, that this is to control people who donate their time to produce software that is provided free of cost to anyone. 

It's as if some people feel the "FLOSS community", loosely defined, has to "step up" and "take responsibility" for the quality of their software. Despite almost every project having some variant of the title of this post (from the MIT license) that clearly states that if you use the software, it's on you. 

Are these people afraid that if they don't provide these assurances, the huge corporations who are now happily using their software would stop providing them with zero compensation for their labor, and start using some other software that does? It's like racing to the bottom, when you're already there. 

There are legitimate reasons to critically discuss the ways in which the xz attackers gained access to a software repository, and how they managed to hide malicious code within what looked like innocuous test data. But those discussions should be focused on the internal needs of the FLOSS community. If they happen to coincide with the needs of companies using this software for free, so much the better. 

For *consumers* of FLOSS, how about not relying on the kindness and integrity of literal strangers on the internet? Maybe set up something [Underwriter's Laboratories][wiki-ul], where you can pool resources for security experts to scrutinize the code your company relies on but doesn't pay for. Naturally, any flaws this organization finds will be fixed and given back to all.

> [...] when we take software from the commons, we are like raccoons digging through a dumpster to find something useful. There is no “supply chain” in reality, *but* there is an effort by corporations which consume software from the commons to pretend there is one in order to shift the obligations related to ingesting third-party code away from themselves and to the original authors and maintainers of the code they are using.

[1] FLOSS = free/libre open source software is an umbrella term that tries to bridge the Free Software/Open Source philosophical divide.

> Kardashian may have loved OJ, but he loved money and celebrity more and there was no way he wasn’t going to profit off of this after he got his old buddy off the hook. So he did the whole media circuit, wrote a book, etc. Was this an abuse of attorney-client privilege? I don’t know the specific details of the law here, but it does seem kind of sketchy, kind of like helping your friend get away with killing his wife.

One of the many depressing things about being out of work and applying for jobs is the recruitment platform sending me customer satisfaction surveys. "How satisfied are you with the soul-deadening experience of applying for yet another job where we will let you know we went with another applicant in 3 months time?"
