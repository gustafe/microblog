News of a massive earthquake in T√ºrkiye. I hope Sweden sends what help it can to assist in search and rescue. 

*Update* we are prepared to assist if requested. 

*Update 2* it looks really really bad, with aftershocks registering above 7 on the Richter scale. I have my own beef with the continued use of Richter scale values in media but that's for another time.

It means helping countries like T√ºrkiye if they're attacked. If we don't help now with a humanitarian disaster, why should T√ºrkiye trust us to help in a military alliance?

### A more relaxed Elden Ring build (INT)

I started my 2nd character as a spellblade, high INT but not a pure caster. I focused on DEX and used Moonveil, but never really got into it. Juggling ranged spells was tricky, and Moonveil didn't have the damage I was used to from using greatswords with my first character. Just before Maliketh I created a new character and started playing with that instead. 

Then I stumbled across [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OjR4Ot-c6A) and Was Intrigued. I decided to try it out. I respecced (basically DEX -> STR) and upgraded the Dark Moon Greatsword[1]. 

And oh man is it nicer. DMGS is so FP efficient, just buff it then strong attack for days and stamina. Just having a couple ranged spells removes a bunch of clicking around to find what you want. The original build included a shield but I skipped that because I was quite used to playing without a shield in my other characters.

Using this setup I breezed through some stuff I've been avoiding, like Lichdragon Fortissax, and had no problems dealing with Maliketh and the penultimate bosses.

The French Republican calender was supposed to embody the universality of Man, but the month names are based on the local climate of France (Northern France at that). Via Wikipedia:

> The Republican calendar year began the day the autumnal equinox occurred in Paris, and had twelve months of 30 days each, which were given new names based on nature, principally having to do with the prevailing weather in and around Paris and sometimes evoking the Medieval Labors of the Months.

* Autumn:
  * Vend√©miaire (from French vendange, derived from Latin vindemia, "vintage")
  * Brumaire (from French brume, "mist")
  * Frimaire (from French frimas, "frost")
* Winter:
  * Niv√¥se (from Latin nivosus, "snowy")
  * Pluvi√¥se (from French pluvieux, derived from Latin pluvius, "rainy")
  * Vent√¥se (from French venteux, derived from Latin ventosus, "windy")
* Spring:
  * Germinal (from French germination)
  * Flor√©al (from French fleur, derived from Latin flos, "flower")
  * Prairial (from French prairie, "meadow")
* Summer:
  * Messidor (from Latin messis, "harvest")
  * Thermidor (or Fervidor) (from Greek thermon, "summer heat")
  * Fructidor (from Latin fructus, "fruit")

Speaking of Roald Dahl, here's a good overview in the NYRB. Spoiler, he was a bit of a shit <https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2022/12/22/making-it-big-roald-dahl-teller-of-the-unexpected/>

This is also very funny considering the recent right-wing freakout over "editorial meddling" in Dahl's works:

> [Dahl's biographer] Treglown, by contrast, makes it clear that the published version of *Matilda* owes a great deal more to the interventions of Dahl‚Äôs editor, Stephen Roxburgh, than it does to his romantic awakening. The Matilda of Dahl‚Äôs first draft was ‚Äúborn wicked‚Äù and most likely based on Hilaire Belloc‚Äôs poem ‚ÄúMatilda‚Äù: ‚ÄúMatilda told such Dreadful Lies,/It made one Gasp and stretch one‚Äôs Eyes.‚Äù This Matilda tortured her kind parents, declared war on her cross-dressing, mustachioed headmistress, and used her powers not to read but to fix a horse race so that her favorite teacher, Miss Hayes, a compulsive gambler, could pay off her debts.

> Roxburgh gave Dahl everything that makes *Matilda* appealing: Matilda‚Äôs unassuming intelligence, the horrendous Wormwoods, the dovelike Miss Honey. He shaped Dahl‚Äôs lazy nonsense into a story, with a beginning, middle, and end. Those of us who gained both our early, envious love of literature and a sense of its cultural imperilment from *Matilda* must offer thanks to Roxburgh. Certainly, Dahl did not. When he realized that *Matilda* was not officially under contract, he refused to do further edits and demanded a greater share of the royalties than [illustrator Quentin] Blake.

*Update, Wed 22 February 2023:* Wonkette has a good overview over how the anti-woke sausage was made: [Oh No! Roald Dahl's Publisher Made Some Really Dumb Edits And Now Free Speech Is Over](https://www.wonkette.com/oh-no-roald-dahl-s-publisher-made-some-really-dumb-edits-and-now-free-speech-is-over). Note that this entire thing is market-based, the market for children/YA readers is fierce and it's really easy to get on the wrong side of buyers. Whether this is cancel culture or not is debatable, what's not debatable is that the market for racist right-wing views is understandably small.

The statements "giant company makes record profits" and "giant company treats customers like shit" are in no way in opposition. Yet many commentators expect that the more money a company makes, the nicer it can afford to be to its customers. The cause and effect is the other way around, the more awful it is, the more money it makes. 

Likewise, people are surprised that a company spends profits buying back its own shares, thereby enriching shareholders, instead of for example investing in maintenance or infrastructure or lower prices. The shareholders are the owners! The company exists to make them richer! Customers pay the company so the company can pay shareholders. This is not rocket science, yet the current cult of "the free market solves all problems" lead to this fallacy, that companies exist to make society better, instead of making shareholders richer.

It was (and is) not fashionable to describe Poland or Hungary as Soviet colonies, but they certainly were constituent elements of the Soviet empire, differentiated from Estonia and Ukraine only by some mild differences in governance structure.

> [...] Folks who have no problem understanding why the citizens of Vietnam hate France struggle to understand why Poles or Ukrainians have negative feelings towards Russia.
