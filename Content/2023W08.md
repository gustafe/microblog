Speaking of Roald Dahl, here's a good overview in the NYRB. Spoiler, he was a bit of a shit <https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2022/12/22/making-it-big-roald-dahl-teller-of-the-unexpected/>

This is also very funny considering the recent right-wing freakout over "editorial meddling" in Dahl's works:

> [Dahl's biographer] Treglown, by contrast, makes it clear that the published version of *Matilda* owes a great deal more to the interventions of Dahl’s editor, Stephen Roxburgh, than it does to his romantic awakening. The Matilda of Dahl’s first draft was “born wicked” and most likely based on Hilaire Belloc’s poem “Matilda”: “Matilda told such Dreadful Lies,/It made one Gasp and stretch one’s Eyes.” This Matilda tortured her kind parents, declared war on her cross-dressing, mustachioed headmistress, and used her powers not to read but to fix a horse race so that her favorite teacher, Miss Hayes, a compulsive gambler, could pay off her debts.

> Roxburgh gave Dahl everything that makes *Matilda* appealing: Matilda’s unassuming intelligence, the horrendous Wormwoods, the dovelike Miss Honey. He shaped Dahl’s lazy nonsense into a story, with a beginning, middle, and end. Those of us who gained both our early, envious love of literature and a sense of its cultural imperilment from *Matilda* must offer thanks to Roxburgh. Certainly, Dahl did not. When he realized that *Matilda* was not officially under contract, he refused to do further edits and demanded a greater share of the royalties than [illustrator Quentin] Blake.

*Update, Wed 22 February 2023:* Wonkette has a good overview over how the anti-woke sausage was made: [Oh No! Roald Dahl's Publisher Made Some Really Dumb Edits And Now Free Speech Is Over](https://www.wonkette.com/oh-no-roald-dahl-s-publisher-made-some-really-dumb-edits-and-now-free-speech-is-over). Note that this entire thing is market-based, the market for children/YA readers is fierce and it's really easy to get on the wrong side of buyers. Whether this is cancel culture or not is debatable, what's not debatable is that the market for racist right-wing views is understandably small.

Either you want to blog, or you don't. If you don't, no manner of technical solutions will help you. (And yes I'm subtweeting HN).
