The market for car charging in Sweden is so amazingly fractured it's a wonder anyone even bothers trying to charge. More than once I've just parked in a space reserved for charging, attached the cable and not bothered signing up for yet another app. The time spend finding and installing the app, creating an account, adding a payment method &c. easily exceeds the actual cost of parking.

I don't get why US right-wingers are so mad they don't have Taylor Swift on their side. After all, they have Grimes.

*Update:* [Wonkette agrees](https://www.wonkette.com/p/there-is-no-overstating-how-frightened):

> [Posobiec said] "We don‚Äôt have Taylor Swift on our side, but you know who we have? We have Kid Rock. We have Ted Nugent. We have influencers. Right? We have all these people ‚Äî Jon Voight."

> Which is like saying, ‚ÄúThey might have chocolate cake, but it‚Äôs OK, we have three turds covered in syphilis frosting, and that‚Äôs cool too.‚Äù

#### [üì∫&#x1F1EC;&#x1F1E7; In The Dark (2017)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5729304/)

This show is all over the place, child abduction and murder in darkest Derbyshire, gangland violence in Manchester, the female protagonist has a dark and troubled past and it's 2 stories over 4 eps. The actors (excellent, as in most UK shows) do what they can with the material but it's a tough row to hoe.

I listen to and appreciate the Accidental Tech Podcast, but it's gonna be a long period in the future where I will aggressively move past chapters where the 3 hosts will be discussing their new VR headsets. I doubt there's anything less interesting to me than the Vision Pro, and I happen to own both a Mac and an iPhone. Listening to these 3 people trying to make $3,500 proprietary headset, only available in the US a thing will be painful.

Someone using an AI-generated hero image (but with a disclaimer that the rest of the content was not AI-generated) got mildly called out for this on lobste.rs and went on an absolute tear on how unfair it was to be called out.

> [...] I got to tell the story about the time I met [Ted Nelson] He came to Netscape to, basically, yell at us for fucking up his dream, with our unidirectional hyperlinks, our documents that were not editable by all readers, our complete lack of version control and transclusion. This halfassed abomination we had built, this was no MEMEX. This garbage had set back the dream at least 50 years.
