I listen to and appreciate the Accidental Tech Podcast, but it's gonna be a long period in the future where I will aggressively move past chapters where the 3 hosts will be discussing their new VR headsets. I doubt there's anything less interesting to me than the Vision Pro, and I happen to own both a Mac and an iPhone. Listening to these 3 people trying to make $3,500 proprietary headset, only available in the US a thing will be painful.

> [...] I got to tell the story about the time I met [Ted Nelson] He came to Netscape to, basically, yell at us for fucking up his dream, with our unidirectional hyperlinks, our documents that were not editable by all readers, our complete lack of version control and transclusion. This halfassed abomination we had built, this was no MEMEX. This garbage had set back the dream at least 50 years.
