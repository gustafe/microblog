> Tv√• lappugglor har rymt fr√•n Skansen i Stockholm, rapporterar Aftonbladet. Djurparkens avelsuggla Percy och hans unge Barr fl√∂g iv√§g n√§r inh√§gnaden gick s√∂nder p√• grund av sn√∂ som tyngt n√§tet.

Lappuggla == Great Gray Owl == *Strix nebulosa*, probably one of the coolest Latin names ever.

Gratis lektion i svenska: "avelsuggla" √§r r√§tt n√§ra "avelssugga" men det √§r b√•de fel art *och* fel k√∂n.

### üêòüêù The buzz around Hive 

I'm not surprised the app Hive is getting traction among the masses fleeing Elmo's dumpster fire. It's slicker than fedi, there's *one* service to sign up for, not a plethora of instances with weird rules.[1]

And you know what? I think a commercialized service is what can absorb the flood right now. Especially if it's aligned with the values of Twitter (such as they are). There's an impedance mismatch between Twitter culture and Fedi culture that's going to be hard to overcome. A service that's prepared to monetize the traffic, pay for moderation, handle DMCA violation etc. is probably a better fit. 

Anywhoo I got an account there to squat my nick but I won't use the service.

[1] I know there are doubts if Hive is really on the up and up, see these threads

* [@NeolithicSheep thread](https://twitter.com/NeolithicSheep/status/1594693728781877248?s=20)

but I'm not delving into that right now.

### ‚è∞üñ• Bye-bye, leap seconds

So apparently Big Computer has bullied Smol Astronomy (and Russia[1]) to stop adding/subtracting leap seconds to [UTC][wiki-utc] to keep it within one second of [UT1][wiki-ut1]. I'm sentimentally attached to the idea that local noon should be as close to the actual time when the sun is highest, but the reality is that most people probably don't live in a civil timezone where that happens (hi, France and Spain!) and DST changes mess that up even more. 

---

[1] the GLONASS satnav system apparently handles leap seconds? Who knew!

It always amuses me to see cryptobros fail to understand legal proceeding basically because they don't see why something like money laundering should be illegal in the first place. So why should someone be detained for doing it?

An entertaining conspiracy theory. I hope it's accurate and coiners get jailtime.

### Gemsite shutdown notice

My gemsite at <gemini://gerikson.com/> will be shutdown permanently no later than 2022-12-31. 

Its certificate has been expired for some while now and I'm not interested in either renewing it or continuing to use Gemini as a protocol for publishing.
