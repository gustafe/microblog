It's worth noting that the same Putin-friendly media outlet that was mad that Hersh's version of Nord Stream was no longer pushed stated that "the upcoming Russian victory in Bachmut" would force Biden to ... do something. So the continued Ukrainian resistance there is derailing some desinfo planning.

Happy to see Richard Kadrey (his "Metrophage" made a big impression on me back in the day) seeing eye to eye to me re: Zevon's "Desperados". It is a great song about L.A. Whether it's the best is not up to me to say, Richard knows the city better!

### Bitcoin price prediction scorecard

Crazy ole Balaji Srinavasan is betting BTC will hit 1M USD within 90 days, presumably because the dollar will hyperinflate.[1] 

That reminded me that I used to have a watchlist of similar predictions on the old version of my BTC price tracker[2]. Let's see how those went.

* 2018-07-06: can't even remember who ("Hashflare cloud mining liquidation, Jun 2018") predicted 8k USD, actual price: $6,673.50 (-16.6%)
* 2018-07-30: McAfee (RIP) (Jun 2018) predicted 15k USD, actual price: $8,180.48 (-45.5%)
* 2018-12-31: @cryptomanran (Feb 2018) predicted 100k USD, actual price: $3,742.70 (-96.3%)
* 2018-12-31: Tom Lee (Nov 2018) predicted 15k USD, actual price: $3,742.70 (-75.0%)
* 2020-08-31: 4chan biz (Jun 2018) predicted 100k USD, actual price: $11,680.82 (-88.3%)
* 2020-12-31: McAfee predicted 1M USD, actual price: $29,001.72 (-97.1%)
* 2021-11-01: BitcoinMarkets post predicted 130k, actual price: $61,004.41 (-53.1%)
* 2022-06-01: [some rando on /r/Buttcoin](https://redd.it/an5kjp) (Feb 2019) predicted 120k USD, actual price: $29,799.08 (-75.2%)
* 2022-12-31: Tim Draper predicted 250k USD, actual price: $16,547.50 (-93.4%)

Let's add @balajis to the list:

* 2023-06-17: predicted 1M USD (Mar 2023), actual price: ???

*Update, Tue 21 March 2023:* I've added a live diff between the current price and the 1M USD target [here](https://gerikson.com/btcticker/index.html#balajis). Currently he is ~972k off.

#### Methodology

Prices are from [Yahoo!](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD?p=BTC-USD), I've used the "Adj. close" value for the day in question. 

The percentages are `(actual-prediction)/prediction*100`.

Sucks to be an IT admin in Lebanon but not having to wait another hour for iftar maybe makes up for it:

&#x1F1F8;&#x1F1EA; üì∫ otroligt trist att SVT inte vill/har r√•d att betala format-kostnaderna f√∂r "B√§st i test" (Taskmaster). Om samma g√§ng forts√§tter i TV4 kanske det √§r v√§rt att forts√§tta titta, men risken √§r stor att TV4 s√§tter sin egen pr√§gel och t.ex. s√§tter in makarna Haag ü§Æ

What's funny about AI doomsters is that they're clearly in the grip of what can be classified as a religious mania but they're culturally averse to being called religious. 

I don't believe intelligence is an emergent property of computer systems, but it's clear that religious sentiment is an emergent property of human minds. 

When a computer gets religion, then it's time to worry.
