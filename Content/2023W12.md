It's worth noting that the same Putin-friendly media outlet that was mad that Hersh's version of Nord Stream was no longer pushed stated that "the upcoming Russian victory in Bachmut" would force Biden to ... do something. So the continued Ukrainian resistance there is derailing some desinfo planning.

Happy to see Richard Kadrey (his "Metrophage" made a big impression on me back in the day) seeing eye to eye to me re: Zevon's "Desperados". It is a great song about L.A. Whether it's the best is not up to me to say, Richard knows the city better!

### Bitcoin price prediction scorecard

Crazy ole Balaji Srinavasan is betting BTC will hit 1M USD within 90 days, presumably because the dollar will hyperinflate.[1] 

That reminded me that I used to have a watchlist of similar predictions on the old version of my BTC price tracker[2]. Let's see how those went.

* 2018-07-06: can't even remember who ("Hashflare cloud mining liquidation") predicted 8k USD, actual price: $6,673.50 (-16.6%)
* 2018-07-30: McAfee (RIP) predicted 15k USD, actual price: $8,180.48 (-45.5%)
* 2018-12-31: @cryptomanran predicted 100k USD, actual price: $3,742.70 (-96.3%)
* 2018-12-31: Tom Lee predicted 15k USD, actual price: $3,742.70 (-75.0%)
* 2020-08-31: 4chan biz predicted 100k USD, actual price: $11,680.82 (-88.3%)
* 2020-12-31: McAfee predicted 1M USD, actual price: $29,001.72 (-97.1%)
* 2021-11-01: BitcoinMarkets post predicted 130k, actual price: $61,004.41 (-53.1%)
* 2022-06-01: some rando on /r/Buttcoin predicted 120k USD, actual price: $29,799.08 (-75.2%)
* 2022-12-31: Tom Draper(sp?) predicted 250k USD, actual price: $16,547.50 (-93.4%)

Let's add @balajis to the list:

* 2023-06-17: predicted 1M USD, actual price: ???

Prices are from [Yahoo!](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD?p=BTC-USD), I've used the "Adj. close" value for the day in question. 

The percentages are `(actual-prediction)/prediction*100`.
