It's true that `make` isn't ideal as a task runner, but people will still use it as one. Why? Because despite nerds scolding people not to do so, it's still preferable to rolling your own shell scripts when you want to run tasks.

Headed into the Big City for a night out, figured I'd take a walk through the central parts to recharge on humanity. Almost too many humans though, and a lot of them were Swifties. Maybe I need to get out a bit more.

We've reached the stage of the AI hype cycle where the ai-brained promptfondlers are reduced to tone-policing their opponents, because everyone hates AI now.

Content warning: community specific nit-picking.

[Yesterday's post][post-20240521] was inspired by [this amazing lobste.rs thread][lobsters-7aglnr]. To me, it shows that we have definitely reached the apex or plateau of the current "AI"/LLM hype.

[post-20240521]: https://gerikson.com/m/2024/05/index.html#d21p01_tue

[lobsters-7aglnr]: https://lobste.rs/s/7aglnr/psa_iterm2_now_has_chatgpt_integration

Consider the situation: a quintessential nerd product (a terminal emulator for the Mac) announces ChatGPT integration, and the reaction is overwhelmingly negative. The few voices not in opposition are reduced to arguing 

* it's an opt-in feature, and I'm not going to enable it anyway
* people are being mean to the developer and are unreasonably anti-LLM

There's not a semblance of a 50/50 split between supporters and detractors. The supporters are fighting a rear-guard action. 

Personally, the first reaction I had when I saw the news was visceral distaste. It lessened somewhat when I read more about feature, but it's still going to be a big entry in the con section if and when I decide to change my terminal emulator<sup>1</sup>.

Another thing specific to lobste.rs is that feature is explicitly tied to ChatGPT<sup>2</sup>, a product from OpenAI, which is a start-up which receives most of its funding from Microsoft. In the normal case, anything connected to MSFT usually elicits distaste on the site, but there's a weird exception for OpenAI, even though their technology presumably powers the newly announced Microsoft laptops which have been panned as privacy nightmares. 

---

<sup>1</sup>as an aside, the only flag I submitted to a comment was in a subthread where users of the default Terminal.app were being called effectively morons. 

<sup>2</sup>to be fair you can hook in other LLMs.

Now this is a seriously cool space rock.

It used to be called "Ultima Thule", which was quietly discarded for "Arrokoth" which is seriously metal. The reason for the name change is not noted on Wikipedia, and I don't know if it was because the term was used by a notorious Swedish white power band.

#### [üîó An Age of Hyperabundance: At the conversational AI conference](https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-47/essays/an-age-of-hyperabundance/)

> All around me, the booths posed a collective thesis on the future. This was a future without busywork or buttons, a future of bespoke experiences, a future where the internet was an ambient thing we‚Äôd call upon with our voices‚Ää‚Äî‚Äänot a service we would use but a place where we would live. Beneath this promised future, however, was a shadow future, one that suggested itself at every turn. This was a future of screens in every establishment and no way to get help, a future in which extractive algorithms yielded relentless advertising, a future of a crapified internet, too diluted with sponcon and hallucinated facts to be of any use. In this future, if you wanted to use a product you would have to download an app and pay a monthly fee. It was a future of ultra-sophisticated scams and government surveillance, a future where anyone‚Äôs face could be spliced into porn. Our arrival in this future would be a gradual surrender, achieved through a slow creep of terms and conditions, and the capitulations had already begun.

#### [üîó&#x1F1EC;&#x1F1E7;üì∫ Showtrial](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11403434/)

Excellent show that details the work of police, Crown Prosecution Service and defenders in a high profile murder case. The usual British hangups about the involvement of press and social media are present, as well as rank hypocrisy around sex and drugs, but the trial in question is extra spicy because the two defendants are rich kids accused of killing a working-class classmate. 

Just like SF, crime shows have a sliding scale of hardness between utterly realistic and fantasy. Hour-long US dramas have half a day between arrest and full-blown jury trial, while this leans very much into realism.
