### PSA: unmaintained project channels on Freenode automatically redirect to \#freenode

During the [management changes at Freenode in Jul 2021](https://gerikson.com/uff/faq.html), all access lists and channel ownerships were reset. Existing channels that were not reclaimed by projects now automatically redirect to the main channel, which is `#freenode`.

If you have a specific question about a project, please make sure you're actually in a maintained channel, and not in the main channel.

If the channel is not maintained, try checking the project's homepage for their IRC presence. It's usually under the "Community" section.

Shorter Russia, crying like a wojak behind a smirking mask...

"We pulled troops from the Finnish border to invade Ukraine, which spooked Finland to join NATO, but now we can't invade Finland to force them to not join NATO because all our troops are in Ukraine getting killed in the invasion we started to force Ukraine not joining NATO."

> “Russia is so weak now they couldn’t risk another humiliating defeat,” Toveri said. If Russia were to attempt to send troops into Finland “in a couple of days they would be wiped out. The risk of humiliating defeat is high.”

> "Gamers" has been a wholly right wing captured demographic since 2014. 'Gamergate' was nothing but a mainstreaming of white supremacist ideals into gaming culture.

Finding out that an online privacy activist is also a COVID denier is surprise level zero.

I've added a bunch of old blog posts that I removed from my main blog. Most of them are from 2005-2006, and when I started tweeting seriously they tailed off a lot. Check the archives if you feel interested.

Looks like the Husk/Twitter deal is a pile of 💩.

### Allmän info: nya gröna SL-kortet behöver inte skannas optiskt

När jag skaffade det nya gröna SL-kortet så observerade jag den lilla QR-koden på baksidan. Den används för att skanna av kortet i SL-appen, för att köpa biljetter mm.

Dom nya läsarna har en optisk läsare som används för att läsa av biljetter som finns i mobil-appen. Av någon anledning trodde jag att även QR-koden var det som lästes av i spärren.

Så är det inte, kortet har även RFID. Man behöver inte visa QR-koden i läsaren. 

Se bara till att inte läsa av kortet från en hållare som också innehåller ett betalkort. Då finns det risk att båda läses av och du betalar resan i onödan från betalkortet.

> That might explain why it is the overwhelmingly Russophone East Ukraine is absolutely devastated by this war while the West Ukraine suffered much less. East Ukraine suffered exactly because it was viewed by Russia as "almost us"

Time for Fusk to buy S&P then...

[Tesla removed from S&P 500 ESG Index, prompting M\*sk pushback](https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/tesla-removed-sp-500-esg-index-autopilot-discrimination-concerns-2022-05-18/?taid=6285148389369800010b97b5)

ESG = Environmental, Social, and Governance. I'd think Felon would be happy not to be included in such a hippy-dippy index.

I've mentioned before but Tesla is fast becoming even more of a bro-brand, so people who actually care about the environment can fuck right off.

HN loudly declaring IRC "dead" and "useless" is objectively good, because it mean less hackernews on IRC.

Rah-rah hype machine.

Can't complain, hype sells, and sales pays my salary.

It's just that as you get older you see these things again and again.

It's not fake, it's just that it's part of a cycle.

The cycle of hype.

Heading home. First leg is on an ICE train that's actually on time and has A/C, so that's good.

Thought I had scored a row to myself only for flustered young woman from a delayed flight to plonk herself down in it.

On the train home.

Funny how the things we thought were super cool when they were in the future, like using a computer on a train, are now just mundane.
