Simplest way of determining if something has actually happened is if Russia denies it has happened.

At this point, even Andrew Lee is shaking his head at Felon's antics.

Current bonkers alt-right theory that FTX and disgraced boy wonder SBF were "laundering money for the Democrats" presupposes there was any real money in FTX to begin with. 

(ofc I found out about this via an Elmo tweet)

> The new OMA turntable, the K3, is a three-hundred-pound hulk cast in iron with a tonearm that looks like a miniature boom crane. It was on the October cover of Stereophile magazine, and the review was positive: Michael Fremer called it a “truly  great audio product.” The magazine listed the price at  $360,000.

I consider myself well-versed in SF history and I have a passing knowledge of the 1930s, but the "Technocracy Movement" is news to me.

<h3> 🇸🇪  Intressanta debattartiklar om somliga kyrkors syn på HBTQ-personer</h3>

Från min egen läsning har den evangeliska rörelsen i USA tappat en stor del av yngre människor bland annat genom behandlingen av HBTQ-personer. 

Från Arbetet.se.

[Tomas Hemstad: Joel Halldorf förstår inte skadan frikyrkorna gjort mot hbtq-samhället](https://arbetet.se/2022/11/15/joel-halldorf-forstar-inte-skadan-frikyrkorna-gjort-mot-hbtq-samhallet/)

> För några veckor sedan, på väg från en minneshögtid för en vän på vad som här poetiskt kallas Hibernia Beach, mitt i San Franciscos bögtäta Castro-område, stötte vi ihop med en trevlig ung man på en bar. <br/><br/>Han berättade att han i sena tonåren, efter att ha kommit ut, blivit avsläppt i San Francisco av sina mor- eller farföräldrar som varit hans trygghetssystem. “De är kristna”, lägger han till, och ingen vidare förklaring behövs. <br/><br/> Ibland heter det “de är katoliker” eller “de är evangelikala” men andemeningen är densamma: de accepterar mig inte, vill inte veta av mig om jag inte gör våld mot mig själv för att förändras.<br/><br/>Det är en så vanlig historia i USA att den knappt registrerar på sorglighetsskalan.

[Lina Landström i replik: "Tomas Hemstad förstår inte kyrkans roll i hbtq-personers liv"](https://arbetet.se/2022/11/16/tomas-hemstad-forstar-inte-kyrkans-roll-i-hbtq-personers-liv/)

> Liksom hbtq-communityt består av en salig blandning människor, så finns också en salig blandning kyrkor med olika teologier. Hemstad skriver: ”Frikyrkorna – pingströrelsen i allra högsta grad inkluderad – har gjort hbtq-samhället oerhörd skada över åren.” <br/><br/>Påståendet i sådant är inte osant, men det visar på Hemstads okunskap när det gäller vilka frikyrkorna är. Frikyrkorna inkluderar också Norrmalmskyrkan, idag en del av Equmeniakyrkan, som redan 1971 tog ställning för homosexuella. <br/><br/>När den moderna hbtq-rörelsen tog form i USA på 1970-talet stängdes de ute från alla samhällsinstanser, men då öppnade kyrkor dörrarna och lät hbtq-organisationerna få hålla sina möten i kyrkornas församlingslokaler.

Was it 2 weeks or 3 between headlines warning about the dangers of "Effective Altruism" influencing policy and the ones saying EA is basically all frauds? 

FWIW I believe EA is a stalking horse for fascists but the turnaround is stunningly fast.

### ☢️ That sudden realization that people who shitpost on Reddit are now gonna inhabit positions of power

> The main couple profiled in the story is mentioned as having a viral Reddit proposal, which, I beg you: you NEED to read to understand who these people are: [How I Proposed to My Girlfriend on Reddit][huffpo-proposal]

> Now that I know their Reddit handles, I'm sorry but you have to now also know that the mom made an anime body pillow of herself as a gift for the dad: [My Creative Anniversary Gift](https://imgur.com/a/A7QDZ)

> Also that the dad posted videos of his kid accidentally eating a raw onion to r/KidsAreFuckingStupid: [My kid HATES being told what to do. His granddad told him not to eat an onion.][reddit-kids-stupid]

The Wikipedia article on [Toussaint L'Ouverture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toussaint_Louverture) is around 11,000 words, and has 144 citations. The article on [Arthur de Gobineau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_de_Gobineau), obscure French racist, is 17,000, and has 195 citations.

# 🤔

*Update 2022-11-18:* slowly slogging through the Gobineau article. According to it, he was so racist he opposed slavery because it could lead to "miscegenation".

I honestly expected a lot more  Nazis and a lot less incompetence from Husk. Pleasantly surprised despite the imminent collapse of birdsite.
