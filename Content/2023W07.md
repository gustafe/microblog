I wonder how American right-wing cheerleaders of Putin square their adulation with the fact Russia is using Iranian drones to target Ukrainian civilian infrastructure.

Did not expect to see Robbie Williams shill cat food in a Youtube ad. He must owe a lot of taxes. Or like cats, I guess.

### A more relaxed Elden Ring build (INT)

I started my 2nd character as a spellblade, high INT but not a pure caster. I focused on DEX and used Moonveil, but never really got into it. Juggling ranged spells was tricky, and Moonveil didn't have the damage I was used to from using greatswords with my first character. Just before Maliketh I created a new character and started playing with that instead. 

Then I stumbled across [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OjR4Ot-c6A) and Was Intrigued. I decided to try it out. I respecced (basically DEX -> STR) and upgraded the Dark Moon Greatsword[1]. 

And oh man is it nicer. DMGS is so FP efficient, just buff it then strong attack for days and stamina. Just having a couple ranged spells removes a bunch of clicking around to find what you want. The original build included a shield but I skipped that because I was quite used to playing without a shield in my other characters.

Using this setup I breezed through some stuff I've been avoiding, like Lichdragon Fortissax, and had no problems dealing with Maliketh and the penultimate bosses.

[1] it's a bit weird how the game throws somber smithing stones at you. Sure the top-level ones are gated behind Farum and Consecrated Snowfield but if you know where they are they're easy to get.

HN very excited about news that a popular initiative in Switzerland is proposing to ban all-digital currency, no-one points out that the organization proposing it is your basic right-wing conspiracy (antivaxx, anti 5G) outfit: fbschweiz.ch.

*Update* the fact has now been pointed out in comments.

Western simps for Putin seem to be able to hold two ideas simultanously: "Russia is a great power and the last hope for Western civilization" and "Russia is unstoppable because it has endless supplies of obedient soldiers it can order to die in human wave attacks".

I am once again reminded that the post preceding this one could not have been written in \#gemini with \#gemtext. In source, it's 5 rows of Markdown. With gemtext I'd have to use at least the double, and mess up my prose with long URLs. And of course, the kicker, I could not accurately have reproduced the title of the penultimate link (no italics in gemtext!)
