#### [🔗 Rise of the Newest Alt-Tech Platform: Substack][substack-alt] 

> Storyful’s analysis of 100 accounts found that many influencers de-platformed for driving COVID-19 misinformation moved to Substack and now freely proliferate on the platform. There, they have continued to spread false narratives around COVID. The platform also serves as a playground for some of the most influential extreme actors to spread conspiracy theories, particularly high volumes of misinformation around the 2020 US election which is continuing. White power narratives are less influential, yet present, with white supremacist group Europa Invicta free to promote its ideology while others push anti-semitism and conspiracies around white genocide and the Great Replacement theory.

### AI rights and human rights

(Proposed reply to <https://lobste.rs/s/umicte/give_up_github#c_gsnu7v>)

Nearly all legal systems maintain a bright line between humans and other creatures. A severely disabled person, or someone in a coma, is arguably less conscious or capable than a trained chimpanzee, but they retain rights that the chimpanzee doesn't. I don't see any difference in the future between humans and artificial general intelligences. They will be treated as tools, or intellectual cattle, and the corporations that provide the infrastructure for them will retain complete control over their labor.

### The term "gilded age" is pejorative

I happened to listen to a podcast where someone remarked that a recent development was good, and we were living in a "gilded age" of said circumstance. However, the term is pejorative - it refers to the process of gilding, where a very thin layer of gold is placed on base metal, thus making it seem more valuable than it actually is. 

From [🆆el WP][wp-gilded-age-name]:

> The Gilded Age, the term for the period of economic boom which began after the American Civil War and ended at the turn of the century was applied to the era by historians in the 1920s, who took the term from one of Mark Twain's lesser-known novels, *The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today (1873)*. The book [...] satirized the promised "golden age" after the Civil War, portrayed as an era of serious social problems masked by a thin gold gilding of economic expansion.

Now you know.

### *Thor: Love and Thunder*

The kid and I saw this this evening. Not too bad, the Thor part of the MCU franchise has increasingly leaned into the more humorous area for a while. Helmsworth is excellent as the hunky god with the heart of gold. 

I did not recognize Christian Bale as the Big Bad (an excellent choice, btw), and definitely did not recognize Russel Crowe hilariously sending up his *Gladiator* persona as a chonky irascible Zeus. 

*Update* reading up on the backstory of [Gorr the God-Butcher][gorr], I find this hilarious (for Swedes) passage:

> The first symbiote, All-Black, is an ancient amorphous weapon originating from the evil Knull.

### *Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness*

Figured I'd catch up on this one. The Sam Raimi aesthetic (complete with obligatory Bruce Campbell cameo) is a refreshing twist on the candy-colored MCU, but the plot barely holds together. It's also funny to see how the MCU is slowly edging up against the parody phrase "the fate of this universe--and an infinity of other universes--is at stake!"

### Salt tax

I was aware of the [*gabelle* in France][gabelle], but did not know about the [salt tax in China][st-china] or in [British India][st-india]. 

I guess that salt is a popular commodity for taxation because it's essential for food preparation, relatively compact, and doesn't spoil. And the production areas are relatively easy to control. 

The *gabelle* in particular was crazy, and cited as a proximate cause of the Revolution.

> In 1773, along the Loire River, which separated the regions of Brittany and Anjou, with respective salt prices of 31 sous and 591 sous, over 3000 soldiers were stationed in response to the massive amounts of smuggling that took place.

### TIL: Chinese numerals

Wikipedia: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_numerals>

> There are two sets of characters for Chinese numerals: one for everyday writing, known as xiǎoxiě (traditional Chinese: 小寫; simplified Chinese: 小写; lit. 'small writing'), and one for use in commercial, accounting or financial contexts, known as dàxiě (traditional Chinese: 大寫; simplified Chinese: 大写; lit. 'big writing'). The latter arose because the characters used for writing numerals are geometrically simple, so simply using those numerals cannot prevent forgeries in the same way spelling numbers out in English would. A forger could easily change the everyday characters 三十 (30) to 五千 (5000) just by adding a few strokes. That would not be possible when writing using the financial characters 參拾 (30) and 伍仟 (5000).

### Wasted time()

In more places than I care to count in my Perl code, I've wanted to output the current time and/or date.

The way I've done it is by using the built-in function `localtime` (or its UTC variant `gmtime`). From the [manual][localtime-manual]:

> Converts a time as returned by the time function to a 9-element list with the time analyzed for the local time zone. Typically used as follows:

```
#     0    1    2     3     4    5     6     7     8
my ($sec,$min,$hour,$mday,$mon,$year,$wday,$yday,$isdst) =
                                            localtime(time);
```

So what I'd do, depending on what I'd want, was to copy the above definition into my code, then output (say) a ISO 8601 time like so:

```
printf("%04d-%02d-%02dT%02d:%02d:%02d\n", $year+1900, $mon+1, $mday, $hour, $min, $sec);
```

TEDIOUS

So what I found out *last month* was [`Time::Piece`][time-piece].

This provides an OO wrapper to `localtime` and friends, so the above code becomes 

```
my $t=localtime;
say $t->datetime;
```

And the kicker? It's been around since... 2001.
