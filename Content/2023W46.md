Always entertaining to see HN (re)discovering that the global diamond market is rigged by a few producers and deciding it's all the fault of feeeeeemales.

> Bankman-Friedâ€™s criminal trial was focused on securing a fraud conviction, not untangling the knot of curious threads that, if pulled, could unravel dozens of different fraud-sweaters.

Being a bitter Unix greybeard is not an age thing, it's a syndrome. Some guys become one in their 20s.

Sometimes the modern nattering nabobs of negativity can lead to something worthwhile. After reading a day's worth of dunking on Canonical for their Ubuntu Pro pricing, I was informed by a friend on IRC that Pro is actually free for personal use and 5 systems. Subscribed and enrolled my two machines. Thanks yrjan, and shame on Canonical for hiding their light under a bushel.

A decent SF show. It's interesting that it seems that animation can spend more time exploring the actual story and ramifications of a SF scenario than live action can.

One example of this is that the trope of "going public" is treated realistically. Instead of being the resolution to a story, like so many movies, in this case it doesn't resolve the situation at all. Demagogues and those in power handle it, and the public reacts with conspiracy theories. 

Season 2... *goes places*.

Wanna know the difference between Lobste.rs and HN? The news that OpenAI has fired some techbro from their board is currently the *third most scored* submission at HN, at 4.5k score. On Lobste.rs, the same link is downvoted to the minimum of &minus;5 as off-topic. 

As a plus, the mods on lobste.rs don't have to beg people to log off so the site doesn't melt: <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38310213>.
