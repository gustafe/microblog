Managed to beat Radahn in journey 1 without any cheese, straight up damage with the Greatsword and Giant's Hunt. Sure I was overleveled but let's not dwell on that \#eldenring

### Epistemic doubt

When bitcoin was announced, I played around a bit with it (I read about the whitepaper on Slashdot, this is how long ago this was). While the tech was cool, it was clear to me that the economic thinking underpinning BTC was just gold-buggery, which has been a fringe position since the Great Depression.[1]

So I could, with just a tiny grounding in basic economics, dismiss the wildest claims of BTC boosters and their crapto heirs. And so far, that hunch, or gut feeling, has served me well.

When it comes to the latest hype around "AI", I don't feel I have enough background knowledge to make a first judgement.

[1] if having a gold-based currency is so good, how come a country hasn't started using one and taken over the global economy? If you push that question you quickly start to hear about that (((they))) don't want it. It's conspiracy theory catnip.
