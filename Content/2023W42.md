Guess we're calling it Egghead's LOLifesto then.

*Update, Wed 18 October 2023:* ok apparently lots of other people have THOUGHTS on pmarca's store-brand techfash:

[Ian Betteridge: Marc Andreessen's manifesto](https://technovia.co.uk/2023/10/16/marc-andreessens-manifesto.html)

> Believing that techno-optimism “is a material philosophy, *not* a political philosophy” while giving many repeated examples of what even a first year philosophy undergraduate which know was a political philosophy does not make you look smart.

[TechCrunch: When was the last time Marc Andreessen talked to a poor person?](https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/17/when-was-the-last-time-marc-andreessen-talked-to-a-poor-person/?guccounter=1)

[Vice: Major Tech Investor Calls Architect of Fascism a 'Saint' in Unhinged Manifesto](https://www.vice.com/en/article/93kg5d/major-tech-investor-calls-architect-of-fascism-a-saint-in-unhinged-manifesto)

> Andreessen also calls out Filippo Tommaso Marinetti as one of his patron saints. Marinetti is not only the author of the technology- and destruction-worshipping *Futurist Manifesto* from 1909, but also one of the architects of Italian fascism. Marinetti co-authored the *Fascist Manifesto* in 1919 and founded a futurist political party that merged with Mussolini's fascists. Other futurist thinkers and artists exist. To call Marinetti in particular a "saint" is a choice.

> *Who* is lying to us, Marc? You serve on the boards of trillion-dollar companies. A few of your peers own media companies. A few others have chosen to bankrupt media companies that write mean things about them. You have been celebrated for thirty years as the genius-inventors-of-the-future. If the public is turning against you, who ought to be held responsible for such a change in the public mood?

### Far Cry New Dawn - farming circuit boards

You don't have to complete Expeditions to get circuit boards. As soon as you've got the Wrath perk, exit Prosperity and head down the valley to the left. There's a monstrous bison there you can easily snipe in its weak spot using a decent bow, then activate Wrath and bonk to death. Reload and repeat.
