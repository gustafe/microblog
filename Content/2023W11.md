Sub-blogging again because I really don't want to add a pile of sodden creosote-impregnated lumber and strawmen to a raging dumpster fire over on the crustacean site--

nerds are always writing about the loss of the small personal website, how they're all replaced by social media silos, how important it is to revive that ecosystem[1].

And yet there are other nerds who are very interested in GATEKEEPING those few sites that exist. You have to implement <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">dark mode</span>. You cannot use any number of labor-saving technologies, from Javascript to web fonts, for reasons of ideological purity, or saving resources, or both. 

Imagine the reaction if you've lovingly handcrafted a site you like, maybe spent hours researching best practices and learning about web design and CSS, and you're ATTACKED by some rando with a GNU-shaped axe to grind. 

No wonder people choose Facebook.

> “There’s been a loss of financial discipline with the government bailing out depositors in full.”

It's been a tough couple of years for libertarians, first collective action was what saved societies from COVID, then they had to run to Momma Yellen for help after they tweeted a bank run.

Great resource for quickly choosing a font style that looks similar across devices. Changed the CSS for this site based on it.
