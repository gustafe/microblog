Sub-blogging again because I really don't want to add a pile of sodden creosote-impregnated lumber and strawmen to a raging dumpster fire over on the crustacean site--

nerds are always writing about the loss of the small personal website, how they're all replaced by social media silos, how important it is to revive that ecosystem[1].

And yet there are other nerds who are very interested in GATEKEEPING those few sites that exist. You have to implement dark mode. You cannot use any number of labor-saving technologies, from Javascript to web fonts, for reasons of ideological purity, or saving resources, or both.

No wonder people choose Facebook.
