Sometimes I wonder if part of the tech community just uses the term "decentralized" as a shibboleth, whithout more deeply regarding the term's meaning.

In retrospect it was a bad idea for me to pontificate about the failure of the Fediverse the same day Twitter's owner decided to take a chainsaw to the face.

#### [📺🇦🇺 Lie With Me/With Intent](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14521436/)

Aussie thriller about a man, his wife, and their nanny. Is she mentally ill? Is he gaslighting her? Who is sleeping with whom?

Spoilers:

---

It's the dude. He's messing with his wife's meds to force her to break down mentally, so he can get custody of the kids together with the nanny, who he is banging. Why he couldn't just divorce her is left unsaid (he's a big-shot lawyer). Why they had to move to Australia for this to work (with the nanny following, even though the couple met in London) is also unclear. Why the wife gets the support of a kindly gay cab driver is unknown, unless the actor is a beloved institution in Oz. The show is produced by the Neighbors team, after all.

Not recommended.

(TV4 streaming)

### LWers ask: "Why was the AI Alignment community so unprepared for this moment?"

Quoting [this reply by @swabr](https://awful.systems/u/swlabr) in full, because lemmy's permalinks don't really work.

---

> Why did the Alignment community not prepare tools and plans for convincing the wider infosphere about AI safety years in advance?

Did you not read HPMOR, the greatest story ever reluctantly told to reach the wider infosphere about rationalism and, by extension, AI alignment????

> Why were there no battle plans in the basement of the pentagon that were written for this exact moment?

It's almost like AGI isn't a credible threat!

> Heck, 20+ years is enough time to educate, train, hire and surgically insert an entire generation of people into key positions in the policy arena specifically to accomplish this one goal like sleeper cell agents. Likely much, much, easier than training highly qualified alignment researchers.

At MIRI, we don't do things because they are easy. We don't do things because we are grifters.

> Didn't we pretty much always know it was going to come from one or a few giant companies or research labs? Didn't we understand how those systems function in the real world? Capitalist incentives, Moats, Regulatory Capture, Mundane utility, and International Coordination problems are not new.

This is how they look at all other problems in the world, and it's fucking exasperating. Climate change? I would simply implement 'Capitalist Incentives'. Wealth inequality? Have you tried a 'Moat'? Racism? It sounds like a job for 'Regulatory Capture'. Yes, all problems are easily solvable with 200 IQ and buzzwords. All problems except the hardest problem in the world, preventing Skynet from being invented. Ignore all those other problems; someone will 'Mundane Utility' them away. For now, we need your tithe; we're definitely going to use it for 'International Coordination', by which I totally don't mean buying piles of meth and cocaine for our orgies.

> Why was it not obvious back then? Why did we not do this? Was this done and I missed it?

We tried nothing and we're all out of ideas!

#### [📺&#x1F1F8;&#x1F1EA; Springfloden SE01 (2016)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5194410/)

Precis som i SF finns det hårdhetsgrader i kriminaldraman, och ett där svensk polis skickar en fd. kriminell på hemligt uppdrag till Costa Rica, där han dödar 2 personer i självförsvar, tillhör definitivt den mjukare delen av skalan.

Serien kan också ses som en inlaga i debatten om nya Slussen, då den ursprungliga anläggningen presenteras som ett tillhåll för hemlösa, tiggare samt grovt kriminella. 

Skådespeleri och scenografi tillhör SVT-toppklass men manus är rent kolportage.

> [...] the quality of links submitted to Twitter has noticeably declined in the last year. This has been frustrating and prompted a lot of removed stories, but never quite worth banning a site over.

Linking to a site with an infamous and growing problem with CSAM has become unacceptably dangerous to this site.
