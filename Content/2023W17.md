### One year of microblogging

This blog [was launched a year ago][launched]. Since then, I've published 673 entries. It's replaced Twitter for me, and even if I miss the instant engagement Twitter gave it's worth leaving the sinking muskrat ship.

I really enjoy being able to write everything from a word to an essay, with Markdown support.

What I do miss most is good mobile posting. I'll look into that going forward.

Ricoh GR IIIx, Fuji X100V, and Fuji X-T5 -- all of these are new to me.

Interesting thing is that Arment was into fixed-focals, specifically 40mm-e, which I like as well. Pros for the image quality, cons for portability, and __big__ drawbacks regarding integration with anything other than a computer with an editing program.
