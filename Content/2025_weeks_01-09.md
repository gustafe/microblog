MSFT decided to "upgrade" the Office 365 app on my phone to something that's called "Copilot M365", and the icon is so ugly I thought my phone had been hacked. Maybe they used AI to design it.

> Today in Milan, a student activist group hung a trash-filled effigy of Musk upside down on a gate outside of piazzale Loreto, where Mussolini's body was displayed in 1945.

> They left the message: "C'è sempre posto a piazzale Loreto, Elon" (There's always room in piazzale Loreto, Elon)
