  models would actually help contribute to such causes, instead of
  just being the ones holding the torches on their way to the textile
  factory.

That's like saying the Luddites should have worked with the factory
owners to create cheaper, more efficient components for the textile
mills, thus putting them out of work even faster, but with the glowing
feeling that they'd made it easier for future factory owners to build
better mills.

(this comment was removed from lobste.rs as "being the start of a political thread". Nice to know that Luddites still have some power!)

Shorter HN on Pavel Durov:

> If a dual-citizen billionaire founder of an effectively unregulated social network can be arrested in a first-world country, then no billionaire founder is safe.

And they fail to see this as a good thing! 

LOL JWZ: <https://mastodon.social/@jwz/113024385254398763>

*Update* the conspiracy theories are going wild. Did he let himself get arrested in France to avoid Russia getting to him in the UAE? Why are Russian spokespeople (including former spy Maria Butina and Snowden) demanding his rights to be "respected"? Why have thousands of paper airplanes resembling the Telegram logo "spontaneously" been placed at the French embassy in Moscow?

This is the most fun since Nordstream.

I think it's hard to understate how confusing Microsoft's naming of their products is sometimes. For the phone/conferencing part, I can recall from memory

* OCS (Office Communication Suite)
* Lync
* Skype for Business (we had customers indignantly refusing to use such an unprofessional app as "Skype" for work stuff)
* Teams

At least it makes otherwise excellent conferencing hardware cheap when its branding goes out of style...

"I don't want my car manufacturer to track me, so I'm only buying old cars that aren't connected to the internet." My brother in Unix, you are driving a physical device on public roads with a unique identifyer that's read by ALPR devices at every intersection and which is legally bound to your person via insurance. You're not anonymous on the road. 

(That's not to say that privacy isn't important. But the solution is robust privacy legislation, not vehicular Luddism)
