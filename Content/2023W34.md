### The Scattering

Every day brings further proof that Dilbert Stark is off his fucking meds all the time and has made it his life's mission to make Twitter even worse. So like all rational beings I have sought other havens.

#### X/Twitter

Still there for Ukraine news. Less and less interesting otherwise. I block the shitty ads with abandon to make the servers cry. 

#### Lobste.rs

Still the best place for me. Invite-only but relatively easy to get an invite. Like all old-timers I'm always on the lookout for the inevitable lowering of standards.

#### Bluesky, AKA Jack's Fascist Beanstalk

Dunno what happened but someone managed to seed this blockchain adjacent techfash project with cool people. Just waiting for the hammer to fall once they finally manage to scale up and turn it into a mix of LessWrong and Gab.

#### Tusktodon

Yeah I'm on mastodon.social, AKA the Threads of the fediverse. Spending more and more time there. 

#### awful.systems, a Lemmy instance

This is the refuge of /r/SneerClub, and it was much better before they federated with the rest of Lemmy. I'm sure there are other good Lemmy instances, but I have yet to find them (not that I've been looking).

#### Threads

LOL.

(Seriously, not yet available in the EU due to rampant privacy violations. I predict it will go the way of the Metaverse and get a bullet to the neck in the near future.)

#### IRC, Discord

Much less.

#### Reddit

Replaced by Lemmy, see above.

#### [🔗 "leftist" fash-washing: "Conspiracy Theories, Left Futurism, and the Attack on TESCREAL"](https://medium.com/institute-for-ethics-and-emerging-technologies/conspiracy-theories-left-futurism-and-the-attack-on-tescreal-456972fe02aa)

Two "democratic socialists" are intrigued by the AGI-lovers and wish to subscribe to their newsletters. 

Someone on [awful.systems](https://awful.systems) attempted to push this:

> I read it as showing that a lot of these ideas, which, yes, some jerks (but also plenty of non-jerks) are into, have deeper left histories, and deserve serious consideration.

To which [I replied](https://awful.systems/comment/322593):

---

The only people mentioned who are not the usual rogue's gallery (MuskThielSBF) are Marx/Engels, JB Haldane, John Desmond Bernal (who??) and this fucking guy:

> Max More was one of the libertarian thinkers (non-billionaire) who helped shape modern transhumanism.

Oh he's not a billionaire, obviously he is Of The Left. 

(I quickly googled this dude of whom  I have never heard and didn't find any obvious techfash red flags, but maybe he's better at hiding them than most others)

Anyway, extropianism!

> like all arguments from first principles, the Extropians encountered problems when trying to extrapolate derivative principles, like political economy. While the Extropian ideas went in an anti-state direction, their logic leads just as naturally to the Enlightenment Left’s conclusion that humanity should take our collective future in hand through democratic deliberation or the guidance of “scientific socialism,”

"OK so *right now* it's basically fascist feudalism, but it *could be* socialism", got it.

More weird framings

> But some effective altruists, most famously the crypto scammer and donor to the Democratic Party Sam Bankman-Fried,

Outside the "not all EAs!" crowd I haven't seen this before,  but the authors are "democratic socialists" which basically means they hate the Democrats more than the GOP.

I can kinda agree on their take on Cosmism, which AFAIK is really fringe (I mean, *I* have heard of Fyodorov, but I have read a lot of SF), but even here they can't really refrain from oohing over the "weird and wonderful" Russian cosmists, while perfunctorily noting that they're all fascists now. 

> Russian Cosmists also prefigured a version of eco-philosophy, emphasizing the unity of all living beings and the interconnectedness of the universe. Cosmists believed that all forms of life, including animals and plants, were part of a universal whole. They advocated for the ethical treatment of all living creatures and the preservation of biodiversity.

> The Izborsky Club explicitly condemns the technocratic “transhumanism” of Western thought, including individualism, rationalism, democracy, capitalism and transgender rights, as contrary to their “technocratic traditionalist” Cosmism. The Izborsky Club reflects the swirl of NazBol ideas in contemporary Russia, attempting to merge Russian Orthodoxy, Bolshevik authoritarianism and fascist “Eurasian” racial-nationalism.  [....] In other words actual organized Russian Cosmists today despise TESCREAL ideas and their Western proponents.

But both Musk and Thiel hate trans people, but trans treatment is essentially transhumanism, how can we square this circle? It is a mystery. 

---

There has to be a middle way between "omg we are all doomed" (which has been a trope since at least WW2, imho) and "don't worry if the planet boils, as long as a hostile AI doesn't kill us all humanity will be fine". And you know? I'm hopeful that if we can get our act somewhat together we can pull through. 

But it's **transparently clear** that TESCREAL ideology is an attempt to 
coopt bright young minds into dreaming about life [fucking and shopping in outer space](https://gerikson.com/m/2023/04/index.html#2023-04-30_sunday_01) instead of getting mad and taking action against the old men who have led us down this dark path.

The answer "this weird alt-right dude" to the question "who uses Haskell?" is not the ringing endorsement it might look like at first glance.

Today's red-hot take: Haskell is like Perl.

#### [🔗 Let's Not Encrypt (2019)](http://michael.orlitzky.com/articles/lets_not_encrypt.xhtml)

I'm against mandatory HTTPS, but mostly because I'm contrarian like that.

The same tired arguments are trotted out every time someone dares question Big Encryption. What if someone is inserting ads? What if someone is stealing ur codez? A little humility in accepting that not everyone wants to shackle their webserver to a 3rd party would not hurt.

### New pronounciation guide

X - short for Xwitter, pronounced Shitter. As in, "Check out Trump on the Xwitter!"

Xeet - used to be Tweet. Pronounced "shit". "Dude shits everything he eats."

Sub/X - used to be subtweet. "This shit is a sub/x on your grandma."

### A legal ban on LLM content harvesting?

I stated this as a throwaway in [a comment on lobster.rs][c_fhob3x]

> I’d prefer a legally enforced method to ban LLM providers from ingesting my content.

Another user asked me to explain via a message on the site, this is my reply, expanded:

---

So, I doubt a legal solution is… possible, because LLM content ingestion is cleverly contained within the space of fair use. There’s very little distinction between Google indexing my site and enabling searching for it, and OpenAI from doing the same and translating the text into a multidimensional matrix.

One is useful to me, as it presents my words to a wider audience. One is not useful to me, because it enables someone to take my words and cadence and reproduce it without attribution.

My main gripe with generative AI is that it devalues labor. Now, I'm a simple country blogger, but this affects educators, technical writers, copywriters, scriptwriters... not to mention the people working in visual arts. Sure, there's a lot of semantically valueless prose out there, and generative LLMs might make creating such prose easier, but to what end? Isn't it better to get rid of it altogether, instead of teaching machines how to emulate it?

LLMs are *nothing* without human input. LLM companies launder the work of millions of humans, and pay thousands of classifiers a pittance, to generate a profit presenting a simalucrum of human creativity. Remove the inputs and the models spiral into uselessness. 

If nothing else, I’d like to be able to charge a nominal fee for providing my work as input to LLMs. Maybe a law requiring payment is enough to make the entire thing uneconomical, without dismantling existing copyright law.
