> Somehow, despite the fact that every single interaction most people have with AI is either laughable incompetence, or brief moments of stolen mirth involving fake funny cats doing fake funny things, we’re trapped in a doom loop in which it is lauded by governments, tech barons, and a desperately inattentive media, all of whom seem hellbent on telling us that this rotted future is what everything will be like forever.

  But you can fight for democracy at home  
  And not in some foreign land

#### [The Year of the 3D Printed Miniature (And Other Lies We Tell Ourselves)](https://matduggan.com/the-year-of-the-3d-printed-miniature-and-other-lies-we-tell-ourselves/)

> For those who had friends in high school—and I'm not being glib here, this is a genuine demographic distinction—40k is a game where two or more players invest roughly $1,000 to build an army of small plastic figures. You then trim excess plastic with a craft knife (cutting yourself at least twice, this is mandatory), prime them, paint them over the course of several months, and then carefully transport them to an LGS (local game shop) in foam-lined cases that cost more than some people's luggage.
