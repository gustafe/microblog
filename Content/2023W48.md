Re-reading last year's Advent of Code solutions and I have NFC what I was thinking.

(and no it's not (just) because I used Perl)

> To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand SlateStarCodex. The <strike>racism</strike>philosophy is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of rhetoric most of the points will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Scott’s rationalist outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Eliezer Yudkowsky’s self-insert fanfic, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these points, to realise that they’re not just trite- they say something deep about SOCIETY. As a consequence people who dislike SlateStarCodex truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the value of Scott’s upholding of the “principle of charity”, which itself is a cryptic reference to <strike>not punching Nazis</strike>neoreaction. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Scott Alexander’s genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

> And yes, by the way, i DO have a MIRI tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎
