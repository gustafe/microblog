Nice piece of science history, and some lovely 19th century scientific lecturing quotes:

> The researches of Sir John Herschel and M. Pouillet have informed us of the annual expenditure of the sun as regards heat ; and by an easy calculation we ascertain the precise amount of the expenditure which falls to the share of our planet. Out of 2300 million parts of light and heat the earth receives one. The whole heat emitted by the sun in a minute would be competent to boil 12,000 millions of cubic miles of ice- cold water. How is this enormous loss made good? Whence is the sun’s heat derived, and by what means is it maintained? No combustion, no chemical affinity with which we are acquainted would be competent to produce the temperature of the sun’s surface. Besides, were the sun a burning body merely, its light and heat would assuredly speedily come to an end.

This piece on the Smithsonian website says that slavery in Viking society is "little-known". Well maybe if you're not from Scandinavia. The existence of thralls has always been a part of the history of these countries. I vaguely remember reading a YA novel on the theme too.

I suspect many modern-day admirers of the Vikings also know about this, and think it's commendable.

> On 14 August, a separate team, at the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research in Stuttgart, Germany, reported synthesizing pure, single crystals of LK-99. Unlike previous synthesis attempts that relied on crucibles, the researchers used a technique called floating zone crystal growth that allowed them to avoid introducing sulfur into the reaction, eliminating the Cu<sub>2</sub>S impurities.

> The result was a transparent purple crystal — pure LK-99, or Pb<sub>8.8</sub>Cu<sub>1.2</sub>P<sub>6</sub>O<sub>25</sub>. Separated from impurities, LK-99 is not a superconductor, but an insulator with a resistance in the millions of ohms — too high to run a standard conductivity test. It shows minor ferromagnetism and diamagnetism, but not enough for even partial levitation. “We therefore rule out the presence of superconductivity,” the team concluded.

### Re: Arguments against the metric system

[Trawling through my drafts, I came upon this [old entry from May 2022](https://gerikson.com/m/2022/05/index.html#2022-05-25_wednesday_02) and decided to exhume an old Gemini post. It was originally posted on 2022-05-26.]

Context, [this post about the disadvantages of the metric system](https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/degrowther.smol.pub/20220525_anti_metric).

---

> [...] I dislike many of the arguments people use to push for its broader adoption in the US.

I don't think this article makes a coherent argument, and I'll try to spell out why.

> I am a scientist and also have training as an engineer. I love measuring things! But in many cases, measurement doesn’t serve us — it serves the needs of the state and capital. It’s no coincidence that the push to adopt an international system of measures coincided with the ascension of capitalist hegemony. 

Societies before the current capitalist orders have measured. Measurement is central to everything from construction, to trade, to medicine... Every society benefits from accurate, reproducible measurements. Even in the future non-capitalist utopia, we still need measurements to ensure clean water, medicine, and the daily allowance of <strike>gruel</strike> nutricious energy slurry.

> Being measured is the first step that a mere object takes toward becoming a commodity. Objects are useful for people, but commodities are only useful for capitalists (I just saved you the trouble of reading about three chapters of Marx).

It's almost as if the largest system of chattel slavery in the world preceded the introduction of the metric system, and survived for six decades afterwards.

Likewise, the foundations of the greatest colonial empire in history were layed just before the French Revolution.

> Adoption of the metric system does not free its user from the limitations of the squishy organic matter that’s using those measurements. Why else would centimeters be such a commonly used measure, when the metric system supposedly prefers multiples of 1000 (and 0.001), if something on the scale of an inch isn’t inherently useful? 

No it doesn't, and no-one has said it would. SI is not normative in that way. 

During history, coherent systems based on the meter have included [cgs][cgs] (centimetre-gramme-second), [MTS][MTS] (metre-tonne-second), and the ultimate victor, MKS-A (meter-kilogram-second-Ampere).

Of course people adopt measurements that are "closest" to what they want to measure. We use *centi*meters for stuff like boxes, *milli*meters for small stuff, *deci*liters for food-related volumes, *hecto*liters for wine production, *hect*ares for land area, *kilo*meters for distance. So in each case, the meter is subdivided or extended into terms that fit the measurement domain.

In Sweden a common measurement is the "mil", or 10km. It's often used when discussing longer distances. 

Implying SI demands only the use of powers of ten that are modulo 3 is a strawman. 

Both [inches][inches] in use in the USA (industrial/statute and survey) are based on the meter, but with slightly different definitions.

When should a user measuring small distances in customary units go from say, 1/64″ to 15.625 thousands?

> The metric system was invented by one of the first modern nation-states, then a brand new liberal democracy that didn’t let its new commitment to the notions of individual freedom from expanding upon the cruel colonial policies of its former monarchy. 

This wildly misrepresents the political realities of the French Republic, which abolished slavery.

The largest, most widespread *colonial* empire was ruled from a country that used those nice, human-based __imperial__ measurements. 

#### Update Sunday, 2022-05-29

[UK Metrication timeline](https://ukma.org.uk/press/metrication-timeline/) 

> 1861 - A committee of the British Association for Advancement of Science (BAAS) including William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin), James Clerk Maxwell and James Prescott Joule introduced the concept of a coherent system of units which is fundamental to the modern metric system. They proposed the metre, gram and second as base units.

> 1963 - Weights and Measures Act redefined the basic measures of the ‘yard’ and the ‘pound’ in terms of the ‘metre’ and the ‘kilogram’. Many of the old imperial measures were abolished (drachm, scruple, minim, chaldron, quarter, rod, pole, perch, and a few more). Imperial units are now defined in terms of metric.

### 🇷🇺  Oderint dum metuant

[Originally written on 12 May 2022.]

This saying, attributed to Caligula, can be translated as "let them hate, as long as they fear". It is a good summary of the current Russian "imperial project", such as it is. There does not seem to be any benefit to being ruled by Russia, apart from an abstract belonging to the Russian empire. No benefits accrue to even parts of the conquered. The material fruits of labor will be confiscated. The weak will be harassed and violated. The conquered culture will be replaced by Russian culture, by the point of the bayonet and the strike of the MLRS. 

Is it strange that people outside Russia fear and hate Russian domination?

Historical empires offered a *quid pro quo*. Submit  to Rome and enjoy the fruits of the Roman peace. Elites were welcomed to join Roman society. Roman troops kept trade safe. Citizens were Roman citizens, free from arbitrary prosecution.

The British empire grew from the pursuit of profit, but it found plenty of local collaborators in the areas it razed for lucre. These populations profited too, and exchanged local control for silver and safety. 

The current *pax Americana* is among the lightest of yokes. The US rules by proxy, by the dollar, and by the NYSE. Adhere to the rules and get very, very rich, and send your children to be educated in the finest universities on Earth. 

What does Russia offer? A desert, and not even peace.

#### It didn't have to be like this

Russia could have remained integrated in the world economy. Its elites could have continued selling fossil fuels on the world market, while keeping its middle class happy with Western consumer goods. Its intelligence service could continue to warp Western democracies using the judo trick of "free speech" to poison public discourse, all hidden behind plausible deniability. 

In a brighter future, eager pupils would flock to Pushkin Institutes worldwide to learn Russian, to drink from the deep wells of its culture, to visit and move there, all while Russians could take advantage and move where they wanted, learning, sending money home, letting other meet them as human beings, and returning home richer, for all to benefit.

It would not be a zero-sum game. Russia would be a place of wonder, not of fear.

No one wants to be hated, only a few want to be feared. To be feared and hated, and reviled, is the worst fate of all.

Outside the "not all EAs!" crowd I haven't seen this before,  but the authors are "democratic socialists" which basically means they hate the Democrats more than the GOP.

I can kinda agree on their take on Cosmism, which AFAIK is really fringe (I mean, *I* have heard of Fyodorov, but I have read a lot of SF), but even here they can't really refrain from oohing over the "weird and wonderful" Russian cosmists, while perfunctorily noting that they're all fascists now. 

> Russian Cosmists also prefigured a version of eco-philosophy, emphasizing the unity of all living beings and the interconnectedness of the universe. Cosmists believed that all forms of life, including animals and plants, were part of a universal whole. They advocated for the ethical treatment of all living creatures and the preservation of biodiversity.

> The Izborsky Club explicitly condemns the technocratic “transhumanism” of Western thought, including individualism, rationalism, democracy, capitalism and transgender rights, as contrary to their “technocratic traditionalist” Cosmism. The Izborsky Club reflects the swirl of NazBol ideas in contemporary Russia, attempting to merge Russian Orthodoxy, Bolshevik authoritarianism and fascist “Eurasian” racial-nationalism.  [....] In other words actual organized Russian Cosmists today despise TESCREAL ideas and their Western proponents.

But both Musk and Thiel hate trans people, but trans treatment is essentially transhumanism, how can we square this circle? It is a mystery.

### A legal ban on LLM content harvesting?

([previously](/m/2022/06/index.html#2022-06-25_saturday_01))

I stated this as a throwaway in [a comment on lobster.rs][c_fhob3x]

> I’d prefer a legally enforced method to ban LLM providers from ingesting my content.

Another user asked me to explain via a message on the site, this is my reply, expanded:

---

So, I doubt a legal solution is… possible, because LLM content ingestion is cleverly contained within the space of fair use. There’s very little distinction between Google indexing my site and enabling searching for it, and OpenAI from doing the same and translating the text into a multidimensional matrix.

One is useful to me, as it presents my words to a wider audience. One is not useful to me, because it enables someone to take my words and cadence and reproduce it without attribution.

My main gripe with generative AI is that it devalues labor. Now, I'm a simple country blogger, but this affects educators, technical writers, copywriters, scriptwriters... not to mention the people working in visual arts. Sure, there's a lot of semantically valueless prose out there, and generative LLMs might make creating such prose easier, but to what end? Isn't it better to get rid of it altogether, instead of teaching machines how to emulate it?

LLMs are *nothing* without human input. LLM companies launder the work of millions of humans, and pay thousands of classifiers a pittance, to generate a profit presenting a simalucrum of human creativity. Remove the inputs and the models spiral into uselessness. 

If nothing else, I’d like to be able to charge a nominal fee for providing my work as input to LLMs. Maybe a law requiring payment is enough to make the entire thing uneconomical, without dismantling existing copyright law.

Hate the little briefcase Windows has added to the "Edge for Business" taskbar icon. Looks like a piece of poop stuck to the icon.

Also, briefcase as a symbol of work? How about something more appropriate, like a spycam.

> But I think the Justice Department is on solid legal footing. This isn’t quite the “novel theory” Storm’s defense attorneys claim, because Storm and Semenov are charged only with conspiracy: conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to run an unlicensed money transmission business, and conspiracy to violate sanctions on North Korea. They didn’t commit the crimes; they aided and abetted those who committed the actual crimes.

> [... the proof assistant] Lean [...] has allowed mathematicians to verify many proofs, while also helping the authors better understand their own work, because they have to break down some of their ideas into simpler steps to feed into Lean for verification.

> But is this foolproof? Is a proof a proof just because Lean agrees it’s one? In some ways, it’s as good as the people who convert the proof into inputs for Lean. Which sounds very much like how we do traditional mathematics.
