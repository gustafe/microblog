### 🤬 Dithering images has come full circle while still staying in the same place 

[Dithering images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither) enjoyed a mild fad among people who are eager to create "lean" websites. Whether dithered images actually save space, and are thus less resource-intensive to display, is still an open question, but the ａｅｓｔｈｅｔｉｃ is there, which is the most important of course.

Enter [pixel-accurate Atkinson dithering](https://sheep.horse/2022/12/pixel_accurate_atkinson_dithering_for_images_in_ht.html) which deals with differing web page sizes by *dynamically re-dithering* the image on resize. 

We've come full circle. We're using computation to make sure our webpages look ugly at all sizes.

Kinda disappointed there's no mention of Richard Feynman in the new Nolan movie *Oppenheimer* (at least not in the trailer).

Giving up on today's AoC puzzle again. This year is the toughest in a long time. 

*Edit* actually managed to solve it after some focused debugging.
