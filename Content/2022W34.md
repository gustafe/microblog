The de Havilland Mosquito is the coolest WW2 aircraft. You can't change my mind.

I mean, this stuff:

> On 30 January 1943, the 10th anniversary of Hitler being made chancellor and the Nazis' gaining power, a morning Mosquito attack knocked out the main Berlin broadcasting station while Hermann Göring was speaking, taking his speech off the air.

Most people say you should be finished with the game at around level 150 - I'm 139 now and not finished with Leyndell yet! 

The latest patch 1.06 enabled offline users to progress in Varre's quest, which opens up an area with both a 10-level somber smithing stone, as well as a very decent rune farming spot. I'm now rocking the Blasphemous Blade, as well as an Envoy's Greathorn which absolutely destroys big bosses. Basically dragons are now just rune fodder. I've made penultimate progress in both Ranni's and Fia's quests.
