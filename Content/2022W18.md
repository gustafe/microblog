### Natofrågan

Jag är kluven i frågan om Sverige ska ansluta sig till NATO. Men jag tycker att det är viktigt att Sverige har ett starkt och avskräckande försvar. Om ett NATO-medlemskap är det som krävs för att det ska vara fallet så kanske det är bäst ändå.

### "We need to intubate!"

I wonder if there's any episode of "E.R." where they *don't* intubate someone.

(in this episode, they intubate __two__ people.)

Well today could have started better.

> Welp, looks like Russia wants a fight with Israel. Russian Foreign Ministry says that Israel "supports the neo-Nazi regime in Kyiv" and that Lapid saying "“The Jews did not murder themselves in the Holocaust" is "anti-historical."

Oh fuck here come the bad Star Wars puns we've all definitely never heard before.

Where we're at it, what's the Jedi religion's stance on abortion? The one example we've seen in the movies show that the life of the mother isn't really a priority...

### Austrian economics - a twitter thread by @davetroy

[Thread starts here](https://twitter.com/davetroy/status/1522725897706614785)

> Austrian Economics (gold, crypto) is rooted in a desire to make the world work in the way some people think it *should* work.

> The problem is… it doesn’t actually work that way, unless you are a sociopath. And even then, there are limits.

> Some examples…

> “People will move to where tax rates are cheaper,” they say. But most people don’t choose where they live based on tax rates. Sociopaths do, sometimes. Time after time this analysis never holds up, despite the alarming chatter. <https://t.co/HSjMRK1H40>

> The other big myth is that increasing the monetary supply *alone* contributes to inflation. In the current moment, we know that cartel influence over energy prices gives the oil+gas industry special leverage outside of monetary supply.

> Inflation doesn’t always directly correlate to increased monetary supply; and oil+gas cartels can “juke the stats” to achieve whatever outcome they like. As usual, complex chaotic systems don’t lend themselves to reductive theses. Behavioral economics and complexity theory exist for a reason, to understand *actual* vs. surmised behavior. Why would proponents go to such lengths to disregard actual behavior and reality to impose their deductive (wrong) ideas about how money works on everyone? Because they think it will advantage them.

> It also enables various shady activities and Ponzi schemes; crypto is just playing back every financial scheme ever invented before regulators catch up. Tech often is a medium through which social misfits and miscreants reshape the world in ways that make them comfortable and fit in. Rather than try to adapt to a world they don’t understand, they wish to remake the world in a way that suits their view of it.

> We should all resist this. We definitely need to have big hairy messy conversations about money and its regulation. But reliance on poorly conceived and mostly wrong frameworks that make sense primarily to teen boys and sociopaths, and has no bearing on data, human behavior, or reality, is not the way. It’s time to discard this bad hand and move on.
