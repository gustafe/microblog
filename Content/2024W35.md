Shorter HN on Pavel Durov:

> If a dual-citizen billionaire founder of an effectively unregulated social network can be arrested in a first-world country, then no billionaire founder is safe.

And they fail to see this as a good thing! 

LOL JWZ: <https://mastodon.social/@jwz/113024385254398763>

*Update* the conspiracy theories are going wild. Did he let himself get arrested in France to avoid Russia getting to him in the UAE? Why are Russian spokespeople (including former spy Maria Butina and Snowden) demanding his rights to be "respected"? Why have thousands of paper airplanes resembling the Telegram logo "spontaneously" been placed at the French embassy in Moscow?

This is the most fun since Nordstream.

Farage, Musk, balajis, RFK Jr, Snowden, paulg... Durov's defenders on Xhitter are truly the Best People.

*Update* apparently using Telegram is a fash shibboleth: [How Telegram's Founder Pavel Durov Became a Culture War Martyr](https://www.404media.co/how-telegrams-founder-pavel-durov-became-a-culture-war-martyr/).
