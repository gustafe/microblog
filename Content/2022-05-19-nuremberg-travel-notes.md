Paranoid about missing the flight so I’m catching a train fully 3.5 hours before departure.

It’s been two and a half years since I flew at all, never mind internationally, so I sure hope I have what I need. 

The classic Swedish 3 P’s are covered: pass, pengar och pilljet.

The commuter train is A/C’d to American levels, ie. chilly AF. 

I’m going by pendel because it’s more accessible and a bit cheaper. The transfer fee to Arlanda is 130 SEK, which is included in the Arlanda Express fare of 299 SEK, but I’ve already paid for a monthly SL pass.

The queue through security is even more depressing than I remember. 

They're doing their best to spruce up Terminal 5 but it's a like putting lipstick on a late 1960s pig.

Found a seat and some free Wifi so back to the corporate grind.

A huge SAS flight boarded and peace has descended.

Damnit I'm hungry, gonna grab a meal now.

Airport fast food eating is its own special brand of alieniation.

In flight. Forgot to load the phone with offline media so am actually reading a book for once. I don’t know why the Books app has “goals”. Since when did reading become gamified? Maybe it’s Goodreads. 

The book is *Hardwired* by Walter Jon Williams. It’s classic cyberpunk that I haven’t read before.

Deplaned. 

A heatwave is stalking Europe, and Frankfurt is in its grip.  The train station is under a glass dome and it’s scorchio.

#### 17:35

The connecting trains have not been running with stereotypical German efficiency. We’ve spent 2h at the airport train station waiting to get moving.

And now we’re on the train, but the carriage we’re in does not have working A/C. DB have roped it off,  but we’re kinda desperate for seating so we don’t care and sit here anyway. 

Right now we're running 90m late.

Coworker got me a beer, life's a bit better.

#### 21:30

Checked in. Room has A/C. I am slowly nearing zen. End of kvetching for now.
