### No red port left in the cupboard

This is the last bottle I owned of 1960 Souza Guedes port wine:

I received these bottles in batches after my 21st birthday. My dad had bought a case when I was born, and didn't really predict the precipitous decline of port wine drinking among everyone, not just young people. But in time I met some people who were prepared to drink port after dinner, and a few memorable evenings were spent with it. 

At its best it was like drinking liquid chocolate.

The bottles have not all been stored ideally, and this last one had a slightly dried cork which plopped down into the bottle when I tried to pull it out. It was still drinkable though, but not as good as it could be.

I'm grateful I've had the opportunity to share these bottles with so many different people. Thanks, dad!
