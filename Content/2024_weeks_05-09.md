I listen to and appreciate the Accidental Tech Podcast, but it's gonna be a long period in the future where I will aggressively move past chapters where the 3 hosts will be discussing their new VR headsets. I doubt there's anything less interesting to me than the Vision Pro, and I happen to own both a Mac and an iPhone. Listening to these 3 people trying to make $3,500 proprietary headset, only available in the US a thing will be painful.

I haven't heard Luke Comb's cover of Tracey Chapman's *Fast Car* much, but it appeared on radio the other day and I was struck by its faithfulness to the original, as well as a queasy feeling that it was a younger white man ripping off the work of an older Black woman. But according to this piece, I've misread it totally.

Bruce Sterling predicted Category 6 storms decades ago in *Heavy Weather*: [Category 6][lgm-cat6]

> Right now, every hurricane with maximum sustained wind speeds above 156 miles an hour is considered a Category 5 on the [Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale][saffir-simpson]—whether it’s blowing 160 mph, like Hurricane Ian, or roughly 215 mph, like Hurricane Patricia, which struck Mexico in 2015. To distinguish between extreme storms and, well, extremely extreme storms, James Kossin, a distinguished science adviser at the climate nonprofit First Street Foundation, and Michael Wehner, a senior scientist studying extreme weather events at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, explored adding a hypothetical sixth step to the scale. Category 6 hurricanes, they write, would encompass winds above 192 miles an hour. By their definition, five hurricanes—all of which occurred in about the previous decade—would have been classified as Category 6.

Oh Wikipedia...

> Many writers have used variations on the series title (including using "Rise and Fall" in place of "Decline and Fall"), especially when dealing with a large polity that has imperial characteristics. Notable examples include Jefferson Davis' *The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government*, William Shirer's *The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich*, and David Bowie's *The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars*.

### The diminishing promises of "AI" replacing human work

Like so many other cases, the instantation of a concept locks us into that instantation. Before the plethora of generative AI and large language models, we were free to imagine AI as something that could do anything. 

Years ago, I imagined a future where an AI would make the jobs of junior level jurists obsolete. The drafting of routine documents and contracts could be outsourced to machines, putting millions of relatively highly paid professionals out of work. (The same process could be applied to software developers, but I didn't really believe that at the time, from memory. Maybe it's because I actually know how to program, but I don't know anything about law work).

Later, the world was enchanted by the promises of self-driving vehicles. This technology seemed just within our grasp, enabling the elimination of millions of workers from essential functions like goods transport and personal transport. Companies like Uber bet billions that technology would enable them to not have to part with any ridesharing revenue to the pesky humans doing all the work. 

But self-driving vehicles turned out to be much harder than anyone imagined, and suddenly all the VC money got funneled into generative AI/LLMs, which promises to replace millions of poorly paid illustrators and copywriters (and programmers, although the jury is very much still out on that). 

And like a very apt illustration of pollution, the output of these models is released unfiltered into the same pool from which the data is drawn, virtually guaranteeing that *human* input will be needed in the future simply to filter out the non-sense the machines are dreaming. 

All in all, it feels like the venture capital billions are generating very small returns, and that generative AI is just another bubble. Will all the research lead to "real" AI? Who knows.
