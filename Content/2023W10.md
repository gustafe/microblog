I dunno, next time you drop $44B on a website, maybe do some due diligence to find out whether it's "brittle" or not.

Frankly surprised the Captains of Industry in Silicon Valley aren't rolling up their sleeves and deploying their own capital to help their startups weather the Silicon Valley Bank default. Instead they're bleating about government bailouts. 10 years of bloviating over the failures of the US gov and one little roadbump and they fall apart. Pathetic.

Of course it behooves the VC crowd to paint the SVB collapse as a bigger deal than it is, it will take the focus off the fact that their buddies in the bank made a really bad bet in 2018:

> The new financial leadership began to shift an ever greater percentage of excess cash into long-term fixed-rate bonds, a manoeuvre that would appease public shareholders by bolstering its overall profits, albeit only slightly.

> But it appeared blind to the risk that cash pouring in was a symptom of low interest rates that could reverse if they rose. Central banks often increase rates to tamp overexuberance among investors, decisions that generally lead to a slowing of investment in speculative companies such as technology start-ups. SVB’s bond portfolio was exposed to rising rates and so too were its deposits.

> “We had enough risk in the business model. You didn’t need risk in the asset/liability management profile,” said the former executive, referring to the bank’s ability to sell assets to meet its liquidity needs. “They missed that entirely.”
