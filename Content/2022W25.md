Raise your hand if you recognize this symbol [¤](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_sign_(typography)).

Fun fact, this was used to denote strings in the weird-ass language I learned to program in: COMAL. Analogous to the use of `$` for strings in BASIC.

Fascists: people should be free to offend whoever they want.

Also fascists: I met a leftist who offended me, therefore I became a fascist.

Sadly common on HN: you find a commentator with "mainstream" Linux views whose views on politics is decidedly not mainstream.

Rightwing/fascist ideology is fairly widespread in FLOSS communities.

I wish I had something to say, but I don't.

Oh yeah, I do: __trans rights are human rights__.

> it really is kind of astounding how disney turned a movie series that defined a genre into endless, meaningless, mediocre tv

[stefabsky-tweet]: https://twitter.com/stefabsky/status/1539649644862787587?s=20

Is it, though? Tweet author is a "entertainment staff writer" and has missed that this is what modern entertainment capitalism does. "Star Wars" is an "IP" - intellectual property. Some suits sat down and calculated, based on previous popularity, current population, and "creatives" previous output, that a SW TV show is worth a certain amount of gazillion dollars. Disney would be leaving money on the table by *not* making shitty TV out of it.

*Update:* semi-related, the grave-plundering Tolkien Society is trying for another cash-grab:

This is just an IP <strike>steward</strike> lich. There's money to be made mining the old man's notebooks, so let's make money.

[ICE must be destroyed 🏴 (@Itmechr3)][Itmechr3-tweet]:

> God this is a HELL of a fucking line from @mikeduncan  about the way the Terror during the French Revolution fell mostly on peasants and not royals: "the Jacobins always pointed upward but the guillotine always fell downwards" [...]

If you ask people about the Terror nowadays they'd say that aristocrats and royals were the main victims. This is of course the result of long propaganda by reactionaries who were outraged that these people were even considered targets for state-sponsored terror. The brutal suppression of the Vendée is something they'd approve of were it performed by the *ancien régime*. 

The Terror was an affront to *human rights* but reactionaries are still pissed a tiny number of elites were included among its victims.

*Update:* next time you visit Sacré-Cœur on Montmartre, remember it was built to "atone" for the *soi-disant* crimes of the Paris Commune.

### Feed housekeeping

I've made some changes that hopefully makes the (Atom) feed a bit nicer to use.

Titles are now "Entry X on YYYY-mm-DD", instead of using the internal ID. 

The publication dates have never been "real", as [I don't really have metadata][limits-of-metadata]. Instead I've faked the hour/minute/second based on the date. But that meant that edits don't really trigger a new timestamp. I've started to set the minute as: 

    (last hex digit of the MD5 digest of the entry) % 60

This should generate a new "timestamp" when the post is edited.

#### [Bruce Schneier: On the Dangers of Cryptocurrencies and the Uselessness of Blockchain][schneier]

> This is my basic argument: blockchain does nothing to solve any existing problem with financial (or other) systems. Those problems are inherently economic and political, and have nothing to do with technology. And, more importantly, technology can’t solve economic and political problems. Which is good, because adding blockchain causes a whole slew of new problems and makes all of these systems much, much worse.

A hackernews is mad that a trusted nerd hasn't signed on for crapto:

"Cryptobros offer buzzword laden pablum for infinite scams, there's your creativity."

> The whole thing is a useful view into how mainstream medical bodies are struggling to deal with their still-certified but increasingly out-there colleagues. And it’s a very instructive example of how fringe medicine promoters—and their allies in Congress—immediately spin their tangles with the medical establishment into more fame and attention.

I don't think there's a libertarian case for banning abortion, but I'm sure HN will let me know what it is when it discusses *Roe vs. Wade* being overturned today.

### Opting out from feeding machine learning

There's a lot of naive fascination with content generation via machine learning in nerd circles right now. Tools like GPT-3 and DALL-E are hailed as innovations, letting people create "content" using just a text box entry.

Others are rightly worried what will happen when gigabytes of vaguely convincing text and images can be created at will, avoiding the uncanny valley of machine-generated dross that's been the norm up until now.

It doesn't have to be this way. Any content creator should be able to mark their creations as off-limits as a source of data for these models. It probably won't stop them, and it might not even be very effective, but it will raise the issue: these models are *nothing* without human input. And humans should be able to decide whether they're going to help machines put them out of work, and to help destroy democracy by poisoning social media even more.
