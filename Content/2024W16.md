I don't want to be the person who tells a tilde admin to do their jobs, but I feel that for the effort put into developing [bunkchat](https://git.bunk.computer/bunk/bunkchat#bunkchat) it would have been more effective setting up a common IRC config for all new users and running a local IRC server. That way you have a one-stop journey to group chat ("run this command to launch an IRC client and connect to a common channel") with the added option to actually use IRC, which I think is a big draw of tilde servers.

LLM apologetics have now moved to "if you're a domain expert and can tell where a model returns blatantly incorrect results, it's sometimes quite useful as a rubber duck". Good return on billions of dollars and gigawatts of power. 

*Edit* I swear I wrote this before reading [Molly White's excellent overview of LLMs](https://www.citationneeded.news/ai-isnt-useless/).

You learn a lot about some specific public toilets in Tokyo in this excellent film, which according to Wikipedia is a homage of sorts to the movies of Yasujir≈ç Ozu. I noticed the 4:3 format, at least.

Fediversians: you may have seen reports of Trump tooting in court. It's ok, he's not joined Masto, we don't have to deal with his stench.
