Lite imponerande √§nd√• att SD kan kombinera fr√§mlingsfientlighet och homofobi, genom att insinuera att HBTQ-flyktingar "fejkar" f√∂r att f√• asyl. Ett tag ville ju fascisterna verka HBTQ-v√§nliga genom att h√§vda att islam √§r anti-gay men nu kan man sl√• 2 flugor i en sm√§ll genom att ta av masken helt.

### √Ñr SD Putins bandhundar?

Inte s√• att dom f√•r rubler direkt i fickan fr√•n Kreml, men f√∂re Putins katastrofala invasion spelade dom helt klart p√• samma planhalva. EU-skepticism, allm√§n misstro mot demokratiska v√§rderingar och split i svenska sammh√§llet hj√§lpte Rysslands inflytande indirekt.

Men det √§r ledningen som g√∂r detta. Sympatis√∂rerna √§r nog mer misstrogna mot "ryssen", och sedan ryska soldater g√•tt l√∂s p√• ukrainska civila √§r det l√§tt att f√∂rest√§lla sig hur dess k√§ra √∂mt√•liga kvinnfolk skulle behandlas om Ryssland anf√∂ll. NATO-anslutningen kunde d√§rf√∂r inte motst√•s utan att trov√§rdigt anklagas f√∂r att motverka Sveriges intressen. 

Om SD vinner inflytande s√• kommer dom mycket snart ifr√•gas√§tta varf√∂r svenska pension√§rer ska frysa f√∂r Ukrainas skull. Men SD √§r inte l√§ngre en direktledning fr√•n Kreml till riksdagen. Detta √§r dock enbart Putins fel.

### CF boots KF

(for future readers: CF = Cloudflare, a DDoS protection and CDN provider, and KF = Kiwifarms, a forum dedicated to crowdsourced doxxing and harrassing people they enjoy harrassing)

Yesterday I went to bed sad that KF was still up, and today I woke up to find that Cloudflare had booted them. The world is a slightly better place.

%

### More on CF/Kiwifarms

This is not a "free speech" issue. None of the members of KF have had their right to speech infringed by the legal authorities. The site owner (formerly operating under the company name of "Final Solutions LLC") made the bet that hosting the worst people on the internet was financially sustainable. They used CF to achieve that goal. Other people used their right to expression to tell CF they were doing the wrong thing. CF finally agreed and KF is free to find another CDN provider on the open market. 

"Free speech" doesn't mean cheap speech. If you're saying something most people don't want to hear, don't expect it to be cheap and easy to say it.

*Update 2022-09-05:* KF moved to a new DDoS-protection provider (in Russia), which has now also booted them. Hilariously the owner is complaining Russia is not a "free country". Also referencing "the Cathedral", alt-right speak for everything that opposes them.

### Negativt f√∂r vem? 

Fr√•n SVT: [‚ÄùF√∂r m√•nga hush√•ll √§r det ett f√∂rtvivlat l√§ge‚Äù][svt-bostadspriser]

> Och m√•nga prognosmakare tror att priserna p√• bost√§der kommer att forts√§tta falla. Senast i raden √§r m√§klarfirman Erik Olssons bostadsindex som visar att visningsbes√∂karna inte varit s√• __negativa__ vad g√§ller prisutvecklingen sedan 2011. Hela 67 procent av de tillfr√•gade i den unders√∂kningen r√§knar med att priserna g√•r ner under det kommande √•ret.

(min fetstil)

Visningsbes√∂kare √§r √∂verv√§gande k√∂pare. F√∂r s√§ljare och m√§klare √§r fallande priser negativt men f√∂r en k√∂pare √§r det ju positivt - man f√•r mer bostad f√∂r pengarna och chansen att man f√•r ut mer pengar n√§r man s√§ljer √∂kar om man inte k√∂per en bostad n√§ra en pris-topp.

[russia-orthodoxy-nukes]: https://warontherocks.com/2019/06/blessed-be-thy-nuclear-weapons-the-rise-of-russian-nuclear-orthodoxy/

> Adamsky‚Äôs book covers two distinct but equally fascinating processes that have taken place in post-Soviet Russia: the church‚Äôs integration into the nuclear-military complex and the political system‚Äôs parallel quest to engineer a national idea, lend itself legitimacy, and rebuild the power of the state that crumbled when the Soviet Union collapsed. Russian Orthodoxy is thus a decidedly secular concept, a mechanical replacement part for the many bits of machinery ‚Äì or in Russian parlance ‚Äúpolitical technology‚Äù ‚Äì that broke during the nation‚Äôs failed attempt at democracy in the 1990s. The church, an institution with ambitions of its own, volunteered to participate in Russia‚Äôs time-honored tradition of restoring state power after collapse, and expanding it to dominate society. At its heart, Russian nuclear orthodoxy constitutes the collective belief that to preserve its Orthodox character, Russia must be a nuclear power, and to guarantee its nuclear status, Russia must be genuinely Orthodox.

### ETH goes PoS

(PoS means Proof of Stake, not Piece Of Shit. ETH has always been a POS but it's now PoS too.)

I honestly didn't think Ethereum would manage to move to Proof of Stake from Proof of Work. Kudos. 

This won't remove any of the internal problems of ETH and crapto in general, but it will in a big way remove the *externality* of massive energy waste. This is a net good.

Sadly this won't be possible for Bitcoin. Only swift and merciless eradication will work there.

My first guess about who blew up the Nordstream pipelines in the Baltic would be Russian military hardliners who want to force Putin to go all in with a conflict with NATO.

However this Twitter thread seems to imply that Russia doesn't really have this kind of sabotage capability in the Baltic:

<https://twitter.com/CovertShores/status/1574750260743880710>

Tankies on HN and Twitter are of course blaming the US for covertly destroying any hopes that Germany would reach an accord with Russia during a harsh winter (German elites are of course complicit). Naturally Russia being the real culprit works in this scenario too.
