### Compact Flash, he dead

I did a deep dive into what the <strike>cool kids</strike> old fogeys are using in their expensive NiCany cameras these days, and it's basically game over for the ole CF card.

The last "prosumer" DSLR from Nikon (the D850) has SecureDigital (SD) and XQD slots. 

The pro D5 has one Compact Flash slot and one XQD slot. 

The Z9 (pro mirrorless) has has CFexpress and XQD. The corresponding Canon model, the R3, has CFexpress and SD slots.

The Sony Alpha 9 has dual SD slots.

#### What the hell is "XQD" and "CFExpress" you say??

Quoting [El Wik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XQD_card)

> [XQD] cards are not backward compatible with CompactFlash or CFast cards [...]. XQD and CFast were both designed as a replacement of the 1994 CompactFlash standard.

> The format was first announced in November 2010 by SanDisk, Sony and Nikon, and was immediately picked up by the CompactFlash Association for development. The final specification was announced in December 2011.

> On 7 September 2016 the CFA announced the successor of XQD, CFexpress. This new standard uses the same form-factor and interface but uses the NVMe protocol for higher speeds, lower latencies and lower power consumption.

I've been using Intel's monospaced typeface [IntelOne][intelone] for a while now and it's actually quite nice. People complain about the excessively curly braces but for prose and IRC it's perfectly fine. Can recommend.

An infinite number of mathematicians walk into a bar. 

The 1st orders a beer.   
The 2nd orders a half of a beer.   
The 3rd orders a quarter of a beer.   
The 4th begins to order, but the bartender cuts him off, saying "You guys need to know your limits." He puts 2 beers on the bar.
