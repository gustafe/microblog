You don't know, so don't say you do --  
You don't.  
You might think that things will change,  
But take my word,  
They won't  
You paint a lovely picture,  
But reality intrudes  
With a message for you  
And it's real bad news  

â€” Aimee Mann

I've finally finished re-reading all the Culture novels. *The Hydrogen Sonata* is the last and it's mid at best.

You can't go 10 minutes without thinking about the Roman Empire.

I can't go 10 minutes without thinking about the French Revolution.

We are not the same.

#### [ðŸ”—ðŸ“º&#x1F1EC;&#x1F1E7; Sherwood SE02 (BBC, 2024)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13994572/episodes/?season=2&ref_=tt_eps_sn_2)

Season 2 of a previously acclaimed show is hard. Season 1 had a compelling mix of contempory crime and historical injustices, with a specific focus on British policing's use of undercover infiltrators.

In season 2 they're trying for a *Happy Valley* vibe. Hardscrabble communities struggle with crime, but the criminals have their own code! It's a confusing mess that doesn't make sense.
