You don't know, so don't say you do --  
You don't.  
You might think that things will change,  
But take my word,  
They won't  
You paint a lovely picture,  
But reality intrudes  
With a message for you  
And it's real bad news  

â€” Aimee Mann

I can't go 10 minutes without thinking about the French Revolution.
