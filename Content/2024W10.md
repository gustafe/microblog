I had a reason to reference this [post](https://gerikson.com/m/2024/02/index.html#d27p01_tue) in a comment elsewhere, and came up with the following summary:

#### The declining returns of AI promises

* AI is superintelligence (SFnal tropes like HAL 9000)
* AI will make knowledge workers obsolete (the promise of "expert systems")
* AI will replace human vehicle operators 
* AI will replace paralegals and coders 
* AI has made illustrators, stock photographers and spam email copywriters redundant (←&nbsp;we are here)
* for $10/month, you will be able to emulate the average Reddit poster (←&nbsp;the glorious apotheosis)
