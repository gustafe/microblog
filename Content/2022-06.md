This is the dumbest thing ever to blow up.

To be fair, this hasn't happened to me as a prospective *guest*, but we've hosted friends of kids many times, and each time we've asked kid or parent whether it's ok if they want to eat dinner. It's common courtesy, if nothing else it prevents unneeded work for the other household.

If everyone is ok with it, we serve food. Simple as that.

People are reaching deep back into so-called history, as if the only way Swedes have from going berserk and killing each other is denying food to kids. This makes very little sense, because in most other social interactions, there's not a big difference between Swedes and other nationalities when it comes to buying dinner, drinks &c. So why is "feeding someone else's child" a special, atavistic remnant from the Viking age? 

To me this sounds more like a viral eruption of the US political factions' love/hate relationship with Sweden.

Rewatching *E.R.*. We're up to season 12, which is noticeably less energetic than the previous ones.
