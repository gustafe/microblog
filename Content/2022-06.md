#### \#Swedengate

This is the dumbest thing ever to blow up.

To be fair, this hasn't happened to me as a prospective *guest*, but we've hosted friends of kids many times, and each time we've asked kid or parent whether it's ok if they want to eat dinner. It's common courtesy, if nothing else it prevents unneeded work for the other household.

If everyone is ok with it, we serve food. Simple as that.

People are reaching deep back into so-called history, as if the only way Swedes have from going berserk and killing each other is denying food to kids. This makes very little sense, because in most other social interactions, there's not a big difference between Swedes and other nationalities when it comes to buying dinner, drinks &c. So why is "feeding someone else's child" a special, atavistic remnant from the Viking age? 

To me this sounds more like a viral eruption of the US political factions' love/hate relationship with Sweden.

*Update* this [thread][hanna-friden-swedengate] by Hanna Fridén nails it:

> All the theories trying to explain, in a nice way, why kids sometimes weren't offered dinner in Sweden are WILD.

> The people who say that this only happened to them when they were visiting upper-middle and upper class-households though, they are on the correct track.

#### More wonderful "natural, human scale" measurements

[🆆British thermal unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_thermal_unit):

> The __British thermal unit__ (__BTU__ or __Btu__) is a unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. [...] The modern SI unit for heat and energy is the joule (J); one BTU equals about 1055&nbsp;J (varying within the range 1054–1060&nbsp;J depending on the specific definition [...])

Mainly Canadian definition, eh:

> 60 °F (15.6 °C) | ≈1,054.68&nbsp;J | Mainly Canadian.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

NO CONFUSION, VERY LOGICAL:

> The unit __Mbtu__ is used in natural gas and other industries to indicate 1,000 BTUs. However, there is an ambiguity in that the metric system (SI) uses the prefix "M" to indicate one million (1,000,000). Even so, "MMbtu" is often used to indicate one million BTUs particularly in the oil and gas industry.

Totally normal island:

> The Btu should not be confused with the Board of Trade Unit (BTU), an obsolete UK synonym for kilowatt hour (1 kW⋅h or 3,412 Btu).

> How did it happen? Well, in 1917 the Russian Empire was close to winning the WWI and getting the immense territorial gains. It would fulfil it's ancient dream of capturing the Istanbul, establishing dominance in Balkans and in Slavic Central Europe. The West wouldn't allow that

> [...]

> Galkovsky argues that while officially the UK and the US are allies in reality they are the most bitter enemies as the only two superpowers in the world. The UK only seems to be weaker, but that's an illusion because Russia, China and others are secretly British cryptocolonies

Usenet was full of crap, but the Great Filter of history has removed it leaving only the carefully polished gems behind.

I must admit: I have a hard time reading Robin Sloan (ever since I read his novel [*Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore*][penumbras]), and this post is not really any different. That said, it is an interesting idea, which I doubt will actually take off outside Silicon Valley hipster circles<sup>1</sup>.

*Update Mon 13 June 2022:* having read through the [spec][83-spec], I have some further thoughts.

I was wondering what was preventing some rich asshole / troll from "buying up" all the available slots, but this is supposed to mitigated by a sort of hashcash like functionality. Public keys have to conform to a specific format, and they are intentionally limited in time (last 4 digits are the valid year, +/- a couple of years.

Items aren't stored forever, they're removed from the store after 28 days of inactivity. 

As the number of items nears the hard limit of 10M, the "difficulty" to add another item increases. 

The servers are organized into "realms", and each realm can have its own rules for how to implement spam prevention, moderation/"censorship", etc. So there's probably going to be strictly more than 10M items, as realms can diverge in what items they will keep.

[Itmechr3-tweet]: https://twitter.com/Itmechr3/statuses/1539659570343071744

If you ask people about the Terror nowadays they'd say that aristocrats and royals were the main victims. This is of course the result of long propaganda by reactionaries who were outraged that these people were even considered targets for state-sponsored terror. The brutal suppression of the Vendée is something they'd approve of were it performed by the *ancien régime*. 

The Terror was an affront to *human rights* but reactionaries are still pissed a tiny number of elites were included among its victims.

*Update:* next time you visit Sacré-Cœur on Montmartre, remember it was built to "atone" for the *soi-disant* crimes of the Paris Commune.

This should generate a new "timestamp" when the post is edited.

### Opting out from feeding machine learning

There's a lot of naive fascination with content generation via machine learning in nerd circles right now. Tools like GPT-3 and DALL-E are hailed as innovations, letting people create "content" using just a text box entry.

Others are rightly worried what will happen when gigabytes of vaguely convincing text and images can be created at will, avoiding the uncanny valley of machine-generated dross that's been the norm up until now.

It doesn't have to be this way. Any content creator should be able to mark their creations as off-limits as a source of data for these models. It probably won't stop them, and it might not even be very effective, but it will raise the issue: these models are *nothing* without human input. And humans should be able to decide whether they're going to help machines put them out of work, and to help destroy democracy by poisoning social media even more.
