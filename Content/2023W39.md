Good UK crime drama, with great characters and actors as usual.

Extra credit for having a The The track as closing theme.

### John W. Campbell Jr. -- cryptofascist

> [Moorcock said that] Campbell's Stories and its writers were "wild-eyed paternalists to a man, fierce anti-socialists" with "[stories] full of crew-cut wisecracking, cigar-chewing, competent guys (like Campbell's image of himself)", who had success because their "work reflected the deep-seated conservatism of the majority of their readers, who saw a Bolshevik menace in every union meeting". He viewed Campbell as turning the magazine into a vessel for right-wing politics, "by the early 1950s ... a crypto-fascist deeply philistine magazine pretending to intellectualism and offering idealistic kids an 'alternative' that was, of course, no alternative at all".

> Bester commented: "[my conversation with Campbell] reinforced my private opinion that a majority of the science-fiction crowd, despite their brilliance, were missing their marbles."

Tempted to make a "Stop doing GNU" copypasta meme. "Mankind was not made to program in elisp"

> Jag har dragit mig för att läsa första delen av Åke Ohlmarks memoarer. Titeln är ”I paradiset” och boken handlar om hans barndom. Här kan väl inte finnas så många av de ilskna tirader som gjort honom till ett av den svenska rättshaveristikens största namn, tänkte jag.

An hackernews is sooo close to getting it... 

> There is a danger though if certain types of sites are more likely to block GPTBot than others, because that would end up skewing the data set that it trains off, which could have longer term impacts on all the content generated with it. If all the good quality sites block it and the sites full of AI generated junk don't, then that sounds like a downward spiral.
