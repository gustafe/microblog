Gotta love how a really really basic post about coding C (where the author discovers that `printf` is buffered) can generate a heated discussion about the minutuae of C standards where the described behavior is just fine, actually.

#### [📺🇬🇧 The Light in the Hall / Y Golau](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt20245230/)

A competent Brit crime drama -- which is also available in Welsh in selected areas, as apparently the show was filmed in parallel. Nothing too exceptional but a nice way to spend your TV time.

(I'd have liked to use the Welsh flag here but it's a bit too advanced for my platform.)

#### [🔗🚆 En Route: A Magazine About Trains in Japan {pdf}](https://www.tokyoweekender.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/En_Route_2023.pdf)

Is there a word for the sort of magazines you get in the front pocket of your seat when flying? Full of anodyne general interest content, heavily corporatized? This is one of these, but quite nice. 

Specifically the article about the train photographer Hirozaku Fukushima was a fun read. 

> For Fukushima, the transition from winter to spring — when the snow is gone but the trees are still bare and flowers have yet to bloom — is the “season that tests a photographer’s ability.”

I feel it.

(found on HN who are under the impression that trainspotters are a Japan-only phenomenon... oh man... )

The market for car charging in Sweden is so amazingly fractured it's a wonder anyone even bothers trying to charge. More than once I've just parked in a space reserved for charging, attached the cable and not bothered signing up for yet another app. The time spend finding and installing the app, creating an account, adding a payment method &c. easily exceeds the actual cost of parking.

I don't get why US right-wingers are so mad they don't have Taylor Swift on their side. After all, they have Grimes.

*Update:* [Wonkette agrees](https://www.wonkette.com/p/there-is-no-overstating-how-frightened):

> [Posobiec said] "We don’t have Taylor Swift on our side, but you know who we have? We have Kid Rock. We have Ted Nugent. We have influencers. Right? We have all these people — Jon Voight."

> Which is like saying, “They might have chocolate cake, but it’s OK, we have three turds covered in syphilis frosting, and that’s cool too.”

#### [📺&#x1F1EC;&#x1F1E7; In The Dark (2017)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5729304/)

This show is all over the place, child abduction and murder in darkest Derbyshire, gangland violence in Manchester, the female protagonist has a dark and troubled past and it's 2 stories over 4 eps. The actors (excellent, as in most UK shows) do what they can with the material but it's a tough row to hoe.
