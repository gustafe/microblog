Other countries: our independence was won during the warmer months when people had the energy to gather in mobs. 

Finland: our independence was won in the depths of Winter, wrested from the cold hands of a dying Empire. 

## Hyvää itsenäisyyspäivää!

Another country that counts its independence from 6 Dec is the Republic of Ireland, 100 years old today but no-one seems inclined to celebrate:

My original #EldenRing character, now on Journey 3, is about to lap my second character in the race to get the final ending I'm missing: Ranni's ending. Character 2 is a spellblade, and I'm not feeling it, especially compared to my current spec of max Arc + dual curved swords with bleed.

#### [🔗 Why Conservatives Invented a ‘Right to Post’](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/12/legal-right-to-post-free-speech-social-media/672406/)

> Conservatives wanted the Hunter Biden story to derail the Biden campaign and pave the way for a Trump victory. They have now convinced themselves that it was somehow a constitutional violation for private companies not to take the bait, and that the state should force them to do so in the future.

> Before Musk purchased Twitter, conservatives had wanted to use the power of the state to control the platform. Once he purchased it, they assumed it would now become a reliable conduit for conservative propaganda. So they threatened to use the power of the state to force private companies to sustain Musk’s venture, and to silence activists exercising their First Amendment rights to register their objections. All in the name of “free speech.”

Felon Husk is right to warn you about Mastodon - it is a dangerous place full of dangerous people talking about dangerous things. Do NOT get an account on Mastodon. I warn you, it is very dangerous! Listen to Melon! Don't go there! People are talking about drugs, and sex, and rock and roll! Stay away if you value your safety!!!

I've had to skip two Advent of Code days in a row (days 16 and 17), because of social obligations. They do seem like interesting problems so I will try to solve them. According to the leaderboard finishing times they're also two of the hardests of this year, so far.
