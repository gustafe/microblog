It would be pretty funny if Trump did an Assange and spent the next decade cooped up in an embassy.

#### [🔗📺 Sherwood SE01 (BBC, 2022)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13994572/?ref_=ext_shr_🔗) 

SVT streaming. We slept on this because we confused it with another UK crime show set in a former mining town which we tried but didn't like. This was not that show, it was much better, even if it really didn't stick the landing and kind of fell apart in the last episode.

"If you can get past the racism and pr0n, you'll learn a lot about LLMs there" is not the ringing endorsement of 4chan as a Reddit alternative HN seems to think it is.

### Proggit gone private, and the future of Reddit integration on HN&&LO

[HN&&LO](https://gerikson.com/hnlo/) was throwing errors so I figured it was the Reddit API finally coming to an end. I started ripping out the code, then realized it was was just [proggit](https://reddit.com/r/programming/) set to private.

Anyway I never really liked the Proggit integration, I don't follow the sub, I don't know its values. If Reddit lets us keep API access and you feel you like to have Proggit be part of HN&&LO, let me know. Otherwise I'll just remove it.

### RIP Oysttyer

Oysttyer, *née* TTYtter, the excellent terminal client for Twitter is no more. The API key no longer works, presumably because of Twitter's boneheaded changes. Well it was a good run, I've been using it since at least 2009. 

If only there was something as good and reliable for fedi....

Just waiting for Reddit to replace mods in the striking subreddits with the very worst of the site's users as scabs.

Case in point, HN bootlickers are on board:

> I agree with Reddit on this one. Like it or not, Reddit is a private company! Moderators are abusing their power and holding communities as a hostage. Reasons why they do it are irrelevant! Next hot issue will be global warming, elections or whatever.

> Guy takes over company because he’s positive that there are awful things happening behind the scenes. Gives “full access” to a bunch of very ignorant journalists who are confused about what they find. Guy who now owns the company falsely insists that they proved what he believed all along, leading to the revival of a preternaturally stupid lawsuit… only to have the company’s lawyers basically tell the judge “ignore our stupid fucking owner, he can’t read or understand any of this.”

*Update, Mon 19 June 2023:* Rogers Cadenhead, still the current chair of the RSS board, points out that the W3C is distributing the Board's version of the spec, which is totally fine due to the Creative Commons license it uses.

Surprised to see an unwelcome nick pop up on Lobste.rs. Submitted entry correctly flagged as spam. Perusing person's blog reveals they're still paranoid, perhaps clinically, and any prospective contributors to their project should keep that in mind.

*Update, Sun 16 July 2023:* aaaaaand he's gone. Weirdly not for being a gigantic asshat.

Nice to see the usual red color of the lobste.rs logo replaced with the rainbow. Now if only the tooltip would say the current gayness level of the site instead of how busy it is ;)

Gmail didn't break email. Spammers (abusing the open nature of email) broke it long ago, and gmail/outlook.com are just the reaction to trying to protect a vital resource from being drowned in garbage.

I'm sorry your rosy ideals of open protocols have run into the harsh reality of bad actors fucking with said protocols.

### Some TV from the UK 🇬🇧

#### [📺 The Hunt for Raoul Moat](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt19788754/)

Raoul Moat was a violent criminal who killed his ex-partner's new boyfriend and seriously injured her in a fit of jealous rage after being released from prison. He killed himself after the biggest manhunt in UK history. Weirdly he became a sort of folk hero online. The show takes the police's side of things, while not portraying the press as depraved immoral attention hounds which is the usual in UK TV.

(SVT streaming, 3 eps)

#### [📺 Cheaters SE01](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt17501750/)

A fun show about 4 people in their own relationships, two of whom cheat with the other while on a trip. Turns out they are neighbors! Dramedy ensues. 

Ends on a cliffhanger.

(SVT streaming)
