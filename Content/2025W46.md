My newly issued Dell work lappy is the same size as my Macbook Air M1 but somehow manages to feel both chunkier *and* more cramped. Also Win11 sux

2025-11-11 Armistice Day

A war widow is technically single so the rebranding of Armistice Day to Singles Day is not totally off base... also happy Independence Day to Poland! 🇵🇱

> A very telling detail in all this, as some comic has been pointing out, is that Trump, who mispronounces words in general and peoples’ names in particular constantly, always pronounces “Ghislaine” correctly, even though he doesn’t know her at all.

Yank websites be like "All addresses all over the world have state/province, right? Might as well make that field __mandatory__. What can go wrong??"

Timely reminder (see what I did there?) that around 20% of the world's population live in timezones that are not a multiple of whole hour offsets from UTC: <https://gerikson.com/blog/comp/30-minute-offset.html>

#### [🔗🐪 John Bokma: ISO week and year in Perl](http://johnbokma.com/blog/2019/09/04/iso-week-and-year-in-perl.html)

%

Yesterday I asked the following of the Fediverse: 

--- 

App recommendation requested. 

Basically, I want to be able to track, for each working day, 2 bits of info: whether I travelled by car or public transport. (this is for tax reporting purposes)

Ideally I’d have a week view and checkboxes for each day, but freeform text works too. 

Must be able to export data. 

iOS preferred, web service works too. 

The search space for this is incredibly polluted. 

---

I got a few reccos, but ultimately I settled for a variation of the [basic idea outlined here](https://terokarvinen.com/2021/calendar-txt/), which is a plain-text file with one day per row. I modified the output to only include working days and added a header with the week number. 

Code is [here](https://github.com/gustafe/weekdaystemplate)
