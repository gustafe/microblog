It's not too bad for me but my wife says it's the worst she's ever felt and she's famously uncomplaining.

My first guess about who blew up the Nordstream pipelines in the Baltic would be Russian military hardliners who want to force Putin to go all in with a conflict with NATO.

However this Twitter thread seems to imply that Russia doesn't really have this kind of sabotage capability in the Baltic:

Tankies in HN are of course blaming the US for covertly destroying any hopes that Germany would reach an accord with Russia during a harsh winter (German elites are of course complicit). Naturally Russia being the real culprit works in this scenario too.

The hardest boss in Elden Ring? It must be the damn jumping puzzle to reach the Frenzied Flame. Died more times there than when fighting Malenia.
