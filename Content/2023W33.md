### &#x1F1F8;&#x1F1EA; *Tinget i sig*

En afton läser Örtstedt Kant  
och finner honom verkligt intressant.

Men filosofens tyska flyter tungt.  
Snart somnar över boken vår adjunkt.

I nattens dröm gror dagens tankesådd.  
Kant illustreras och blir lättförstådd.

Det kommer, svept i brokig omslagsfärg,  
till Örtstedt ett paket från Königsberg.

Aktas för stötar! står det utanpå  
med petig stil som verkar rokoko.

Avsändare och varans fabrikant  
är ingen mindre än professor Kant.

Han granskar lådan vid sin fönsternisch.  
Det står som innehåll: *DAS DING AN SICH*.

Kring tinget i sig själv, de vises sten,  
är sinnevärlden blott ett brokigt sken.

Vem törs dock rycka undan slöjan kring  
den rena verkligheten, tingens ting?

Adjunkten Örtstedt ryggar bort bestört  
från det som ingen sett och ingen rört.

Om gåvan i hans grova händer sprack!  
-- Han returnerar den med tusen tack.

-- Hjalmar Gullberg, 1935

Every time some chode bounces off a Code of Conduct and vows not to contribute because of it, that CoC is doing its job.

*Update* This is the CoC in question, it's for [the Fennel language](https://github.com/bakpakin/Fennel/blob/main/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md). It's pretty awesome!

The *only* reason I even know this exists is that someone, no doubt a fan of Freeze Peach, tried to snark on the following

> Any attempt to present "reverse-ism" versions of the above as violations. Examples of reverse-isms are "reverse racism", "reverse sexism", "heterophobia", and "cisphobia".

The fact that someone else then tried to present this as proof of discrimination against "certain groups" is just *so meta*.

#### [🔗🧪 LK-99 isn’t a superconductor — how science sleuths solved the mystery](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02585-7)

> On 14 August, a separate team, at the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research in Stuttgart, Germany, reported synthesizing pure, single crystals of LK-99. Unlike previous synthesis attempts that relied on crucibles, the researchers used a technique called floating zone crystal growth that allowed them to avoid introducing sulfur into the reaction, eliminating the Cu<sub>2</sub>S impurities.

> The result was a transparent purple crystal — pure LK-99, or Pb<sub>8.8</sub>Cu<sub>1.2</sub>P<sub>6</sub>O<sub>25</sub>. Separated from impurities, LK-99 is not a superconductor, but an insulator with a resistance in the millions of ohms — too high to run a standard conductivity test. It shows minor ferromagnetism and diamagnetism, but not enough for even partial levitation. “We therefore rule out the presence of superconductivity,” the team concluded.

### Re: Arguments against the metric system

[Trawling through my drafts, I came upon this [old entry from May 2022](https://gerikson.com/m/2022/05/index.html#2022-05-25_wednesday_02) and decided to exhume an old Gemini post. It was originally posted on 2022-05-26.]

Context, [this post about the disadvantages of the metric system](https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/degrowther.smol.pub/20220525_anti_metric).

---

> [...] I dislike many of the arguments people use to push for its broader adoption in the US.

I don't think this article makes a coherent argument, and I'll try to spell out why.

> I am a scientist and also have training as an engineer. I love measuring things! But in many cases, measurement doesn’t serve us — it serves the needs of the state and capital. It’s no coincidence that the push to adopt an international system of measures coincided with the ascension of capitalist hegemony. 

Societies before the current capitalist orders have measured. Measurement is central to everything from construction, to trade, to medicine... Every society benefits from accurate, reproducible measurements. Even in the future non-capitalist utopia, we still need measurements to ensure clean water, medicine, and the daily allowance of <strike>gruel</strike> nutricious energy slurry.

> Being measured is the first step that a mere object takes toward becoming a commodity. Objects are useful for people, but commodities are only useful for capitalists (I just saved you the trouble of reading about three chapters of Marx).

It's almost as if the largest system of chattel slavery in the world preceded the introduction of the metric system, and survived for six decades afterwards.

Likewise, the foundations of the greatest colonial empire in history were layed just before the French Revolution.

> Adoption of the metric system does not free its user from the limitations of the squishy organic matter that’s using those measurements. Why else would centimeters be such a commonly used measure, when the metric system supposedly prefers multiples of 1000 (and 0.001), if something on the scale of an inch isn’t inherently useful? 

No it doesn't, and no-one has said it would. SI is not normative in that way. 

During history, coherent systems based on the meter have included [cgs][cgs] (centimetre-gramme-second), [MTS][MTS] (metre-tonne-second), and the ultimate victor, MKS-A (meter-kilogram-second-Ampere).

Of course people adopt measurements that are "closest" to what they want to measure. We use *centi*meters for stuff like boxes, *milli*meters for small stuff, *deci*liters for food-related volumes, *hecto*liters for wine production, *hect*ares for land area, *kilo*meters for distance. So in each case, the meter is subdivided or extended into terms that fit the measurement domain.

In Sweden a common measurement is the "mil", or 10km. It's often used when discussing longer distances. 

Implying SI demands only the use of powers of ten that are modulo 3 is a strawman. 

Both [inches][inches] in use in the USA (industrial/statute and survey) are based on the meter, but with slightly different definitions.

When should a user measuring small distances in customary units go from say, 1/64″ to 15.625 thousands?

> The metric system was invented by one of the first modern nation-states, then a brand new liberal democracy that didn’t let its new commitment to the notions of individual freedom from expanding upon the cruel colonial policies of its former monarchy. 

This wildly misrepresents the political realities of the French Republic, which abolished slavery.

The largest, most widespread *colonial* empire was ruled from a country that used those nice, human-based __imperial__ measurements. 

#### Update Sunday, 2022-05-29

[UK Metrication timeline](https://ukma.org.uk/press/metrication-timeline/) 

> 1861 - A committee of the British Association for Advancement of Science (BAAS) including William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin), James Clerk Maxwell and James Prescott Joule introduced the concept of a coherent system of units which is fundamental to the modern metric system. They proposed the metre, gram and second as base units.

> 1963 - Weights and Measures Act redefined the basic measures of the ‘yard’ and the ‘pound’ in terms of the ‘metre’ and the ‘kilogram’. Many of the old imperial measures were abolished (drachm, scruple, minim, chaldron, quarter, rod, pole, perch, and a few more). Imperial units are now defined in terms of metric.

### 🇷🇺  Oderint dum metuant

[Originally written on 12 May 2022.]

This saying, attributed to Caligula, can be translated as "let them hate, as long as they fear". It is a good summary of the current Russian "imperial project", such as it is. There does not seem to be any benefit to being ruled by Russia, apart from an abstract belonging to the Russian empire. No benefits accrue to even parts of the conquered. The material fruits of labor will be confiscated. The weak will be harassed and violated. The conquered culture will be replaced by Russian culture, by the point of the bayonet and the strike of the MLRS. 

Is it strange that people outside Russia fear and hate Russian domination?

Historical empires offered a *quid pro quo*. Submit  to Rome and enjoy the fruits of the Roman peace. Elites were welcomed to join Roman society. Roman troops kept trade safe. Citizens were Roman citizens, free from arbitrary prosecution.

The British empire grew from the pursuit of profit, but it found plenty of local collaborators in the areas it razed for lucre. These populations profited too, and exchanged local control for silver and safety. 

The current *pax Americana* is among the lightest of yokes. The US rules by proxy, by the dollar, and by the NYSE. Adhere to the rules and get very, very rich, and send your children to be educated in the finest universities on Earth. 

What does Russia offer? A desert, and not even peace.

#### It didn't have to be like this

Russia could have remained integrated in the world economy. Its elites could have continued selling fossil fuels on the world market, while keeping its middle class happy with Western consumer goods. Its intelligence service could continue to warp Western democracies using the judo trick of "free speech" to poison public discourse, all hidden behind plausible deniability. 

In a brighter future, eager pupils would flock to Pushkin Institutes worldwide to learn Russian, to drink from the deep wells of its culture, to visit and move there, all while Russians could take advantage and move where they wanted, learning, sending money home, letting other meet them as human beings, and returning home richer, for all to benefit.

It would not be a zero-sum game. Russia would be a place of wonder, not of fear.

No one wants to be hated, only a few want to be feared. To be feared and hated, and reviled, is the worst fate of all.
