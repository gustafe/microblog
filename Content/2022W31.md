NGL kinda looking forward to the Old River Control Structure failing just 
because I've been reading about it a lot. People know about the Yellowstone Caldera but the ORCS collapsing is more of a deep cut catastrophe.

John McPhee devotes a lot of space in his *The Control of Nature* to it.

### Usenet is (still) dead

When the Gemini mailing list fell off the face of the 'Net some blowhards celebrated, now everything could move to Usenet. Intrigued to see if this followed the usual pattern of Gemini predictions, I got an account at eternal-september.org, dusted off my `Gnus` config, and awaited the arrival of ... *crickets*. Not surprisingly no-one bothered using Usenet and the gadfly community is eagerly casting around for the next technical solution to social problems.

#### everyone hates Microsoft (again)

I commented [here][c_f5hiph]:

> Linux-tinged hatred of Microsoft is a meme in the original sense - I’m surprised seeing nerds a generation younger than me essentially repeating the same tropes people I knew did in the late 90s. [...]

One difference is that I don't remember Linux boosters being quite so right-libertarian back in the day. Lunduke himself is rabidly anti-abortion, for example.

#### ["Cheating?! In this casino?? Well I never!!][solana-sockpuppets]

> Coding as 11 purportedly independent developers, Ian [Macalinao], a 20-something computer wiz from Texas, created a vast web of interlocking DeFi protocols that projected billions of dollars of double-counted value onto the Saber ecosystem. That temporarily inflated the total value locked (TVL) on Solana, as the network was racing toward its zenith last November. The DeFi faithful regard TVL as a barometer for on-chain activity.

HN: "The public should listen to experts and stop being so afraid of nuclear power."

Rest of world: "The public should listen to experts about COVID vaccines too, then?"

HN: "Don't be silly."
