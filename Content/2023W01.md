Known crazy bitcoiner / sedevacantist Luke-JR has been hacked [according to his Twitter](https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/1609613748364509184?s=20). Personally I think it's more likely his Twitter account has been compromised, but let's live in hope that 2023 starts with him getting all his coins jacked.

*Update:* Peter Todd [confirms it's Luke tweeting](https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/1609655629903265795?s=20).

As another data point, Luke's mastodon account hasn't posted since 25 Dec 2022, so Twitter is not dead yet...

Better to be considered a fool for blathering on about colonizing Mars, than to buy Twitter and remove all doubt.

Russia produced a wire-guided antitank missile called "Konkurs" which means "contest" in Russian but "bankruptcy" in Swedish.

Interested in the etymology I consulted [SAOB](https://www.saob.se/artikel/?unik=K_1987-0305.Ax2Q) and was informed the Swedish term is from Latin *concursus*, an assembly of people (creditors in this case), so they have the same root.

&#x1F1F8;&#x1F1EA; vi ska kanske vara tacksamma att Orbán inte fick för sig att kräva förbud av HBTQ-personer i Sverige för att släppa in oss i NATO. Billström hade kanske gått med på det också.

Fascinating article about how Jordan algebras became well-known despite their namesake being an ardent Nazi. 

Despite this he worked with two Jewish mathematicians, Wigner and von Neumann, and could not resist making lame mathematician jokes about his parlous finances in a letter:

> It is really very sad that we have so little prospect of seeing each other within the foreseeable future; there are so many things I would like to talk with you about. But I am fighting a desperate struggle against my financial deficit’s tendency to increase monotonically.

Looks like the Roald Dahl estate have managed to piss off both the left and right by editing his children's books to remove offensive content.
