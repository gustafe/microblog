Known crazy bitcoiner / sedevacantist Luke-JR has been hacked [according to his Twitter](https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/1609613748364509184?s=20). Personally I think it's more likely his Twitter account has been compromised, but let's live in hope that 2023 starts with him getting all his coins jacked.

*Update:* Peter Todd [confirms it's Luke tweeting](https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/1609655629903265795?s=20).

As another data point, Luke's mastodon account hasn't posted since 25 Dec 2022, so Twitter is not dead yet...

Better to be considered a fool for blathering on about colonizing Mars, than to buy Twitter and remove all doubt.
