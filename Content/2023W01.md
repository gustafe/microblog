Known crazy bitcoiner / sedevacantist Luke-JR has been hacked [according to his Twitter](https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/1609613748364509184?s=20). Personally I think it's more likely his Twitter account has been compromised, but let's live in hope that 2023 starts with him getting all his coins jacked.

*Update:* Peter Todd [confirms it's Luke tweeting](https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/1609655629903265795?s=20).

As another data point, Luke's mastodon account hasn't posted since 25 Dec 2022, so Twitter is not dead yet...

Better to be considered a fool for blathering on about colonizing Mars, than to buy Twitter and remove all doubt.

Russia produced a wire-guided antitank missile called "Konkurs" which means "contest" in Russian but "bankruptcy" in Swedish.

Interested in the etymology I consulted [SAOB](https://www.saob.se/artikel/?unik=K_1987-0305.Ax2Q) and was informed the Swedish term is from Latin *concursus*, an assembly of people (creditors in this case), so they have the same root.

Fascinating article about how Jordan algebras became well-known despite their namesake being an ardent Nazi. 

Despite this he worked with two Jewish mathematicians, Wigner and von Neumann, and could not resist making lame mathematician jokes about his parlous finances in a letter:

> It is really very sad that we have so little prospect of seeing each other within the foreseeable future; there are so many things I would like to talk with you about. But I am fighting a desperate struggle against my financial deficit’s tendency to increase monotonically.

The French Republican calender was supposed to embody the universality of Man, but the month names are based on the local climate of France (Northern France at that). Via Wikipedia:

> The Republican calendar year began the day the autumnal equinox occurred in Paris, and had twelve months of 30 days each, which were given new names based on nature, principally having to do with the prevailing weather in and around Paris and sometimes evoking the Medieval Labors of the Months.

* Autumn:
** Vendémiaire (from French vendange, derived from Latin vindemia, "vintage")
** Brumaire (from French brume, "mist")
** Frimaire (from French frimas, "frost")
* Winter:
** Nivôse (from Latin nivosus, "snowy")
** Pluviôse (from French pluvieux, derived from Latin pluvius, "rainy")
** Ventôse (from French venteux, derived from Latin ventosus, "windy")
* Spring:
** Germinal (from French germination)
** Floréal (from French fleur, derived from Latin flos, "flower")
** Prairial (from French prairie, "meadow")
* Summer:
** Messidor (from Latin messis, "harvest")
** Thermidor (or Fervidor) (from Greek thermon, "summer heat")
** Fructidor (from Latin fructus, "fruit")
