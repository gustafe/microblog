### Luna

Back in uni, there was a room in the computer lab with a bunch of Sun pizza box workstations - I believe they were Ultrasparcs.

The naming convention was celestial satellites, so we had names like Callisto, Miranda, Phoebe, and ... Moon.

Moon. Not Luna. Not Selene. Not Cynthia. (OK, Cynthia would have been weird.)

Still haven't gotten over it.

(update 2022-05-13: after this was written, some shitty "algorithmic stablecoin" with Luna in its name went tits-up and disappeared. This post is entirely coincidental to that. Unfortunately.)

### Rasmus Paludan and "free speech"

Rasmus Paludan is a craven little shitweasel and I hope he meets the fate he deserves as soon as possible.

[@ChrChristensen thread](https://twitter.com/ChrChristensen/status/1525043012694327296?s=20)

> Danish far-right "activist" Rasmus Paludan burnt 3 Qur'ans in Sweden yesterday. There's a tendency to claim that people who criticize these acts are "against free speech." That's not only intellectually juvenile, but shows a lack of understanding about how free speech works.

> Critiquing the MANNER in which free speech is exercised isn't the same thing as saying the right should be revoked or speech banned. For example, I was opposed to the US occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan. I was also opposed to any bans on protesting against these occupations.

> But, if anti-war protesters staged a protest at the funeral of a soldier killed in the war with signs saying the solder deserved to die, I'd critique both the MANNER and CONTENT of their speech. That doesn't mean I'd ban either their right to gather or their right to speak.

> Citizens exercising their free speech rights to question how others have exercised their free speech rights is actually the perfect crystallization of free speech and democratic engagement in action. To suggest hard critique of speech stifles free speech is counterintuitive.

> When Paludan wraps his Islamophobia in "free speech," don't be surprised if others exercise their rights to then call out what they consider a transparent attack on a religious group. Labeling those who do so as "anti-free speech" is, ironically, an attempt to stifle speech.

> Journalists, politicians, pundits forever whine about behavior that's perfectly legal, but they consider anti-social. The message? Just because you have the right to do something doesn't mean it's the right/responsible/democratic decision. Precisely what critics tell Paludan.

> It's amusing to see opinion leaders who spend a huge amount of time telling citizens about the "correct" and "incorrect" way to exercise their freedoms -- like, say, telling Muslim women what they should wear -- suddenly wetting their pants when Qur'an-burners are criticized.

> What this comes down to is how framing of freedoms/rights varies dramatically depending on whose rights are discussed. Paludan? Then it's the letter of the law that matters. Immigrants? Well, then we begin to critique based on things like "values." Legal rights less important.

### [HTML Only](https://lobste.rs/s/s4jsru/html_only)

Interesting submission about a super simple way to blog. 

I must say I'm pleasantly surprised how fast this blog setup is. All data (basically most tweets since 2007 plus stuff I've written since the end of April) is 1.8MB of text in fortune format, and takes under 3s to render to HTML from Markdown.

Anyway, people should do whatever. I've long held the opinion that manually writing HTML/XML (closing tags etc) is a huge pain, and the advent of Markdown was a sweet release from that pain. For some unfathomable reason static site generators have ballooned in complexity. If you just want a frikkin' site, MD + some perl has you covered.

> There are two things that get in the way of blogging: not having an inspiration on what to write, and having too many steps between wanting to write and publishing.

So true.

### Eurovision 2022

Man it's hard for me to resist going back to Twitter to snark-tweet.

CZE: should have a flashing light warning

SUI: this is causing depression

FRA: what language were they singing in? - it was Breton

NOR: I am at a loss for words

SPA: ¬°muy caliente! 

AZE: defeated by ARM in this competition

ISL: The Corrs go to Iceland

MDA: Russia, please invade and put a stop to this

SWE: Go Cornelia!

 UK: it's like the BeeGees and David Bowie had a love child

POL: morbid

SRB: at least they tried

#### Voting

La Suisse: null points

### UKR wins! 

What has Putin wrought.

@michel\_v: Allemagne ou Royaume-Uni pour la derni√®re place cette ann√©e ? #Eurovision  
@gerikson: La France, par chance?  
@michel\_v: Our Belgian vassals would never let us down.  
@gerikson: at least FRA has 1 more point than GER right now, they have 0. But GBR in the lead :D  
@michel\_v: [Narrator's voice] Of course the Belgian vassals let us down.  

GER didn't deserve last place btw.

At the same time we're watching the glittering confection of Eurovision, a racist kills at least 10 in Buffalo NY and livestreams it on Twitch. Sickening.
