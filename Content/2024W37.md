I think it's hard to understate how confusing Microsoft's naming of their products is sometimes. For the phone/conferencing part, I can recall from memory

* OCS (Office Communication Suite)
* Lync
* Skype for Business (we had customers indignantly refusing to use such an unprofessional app as "Skype" for work stuff)
* Teams

At least it makes otherwise excellent conferencing hardware cheap when its branding goes out of style...
