Not really enjoying cosplaying the 1930s, waiting for the election of a dictator and arguing with callow youths calling me "Socialfascizmus" (well, "Eurocentric Swede").

Itâ€™s amusing that GenAI hawkers have transformed programming from creative problem solving to code reviewing the output of an amnesiac corgi dog and are surprised programmers arenâ€™t happy. Programmers famously love to review code!

It's depressingly clear that a significant number of Americans don't see Hitler's rise to power in 1933 as a warning, but as a blueprint. 

*edit* good thing I run my own blog so I don't get banned for mentioning Hitler, unlike [people on Threads](https://www.techdirt.com/2024/11/01/threads-bans-anyone-for-mentioning-hitler-even-to-criticize/)

> You (group A) think C is simple, that it can be thought of as portable assembly, that it teaches you how computers actually work, and that itâ€™s easy to avoid memory safety errors with good programming discipline, and is therefore fine.

> You (group B) think C is deceptively complex, is far removed from current-day real world hardware semantics, abstracts memory in an outdated and overly simplified manner, and that itâ€™s very hard for even professionals to write programs that are correct to the extent of equivalent programs in memory safe languages, therefore C shouldnâ€™t be use for new software development.

> I think C is deceptively complex, is far removed from current-day real world hardware semantics, abstracts memory in an outdated and overly simplified manner, and that itâ€™s very hard for even professionals to write programs that are correct to the extent of equivalent programs in memory safe languages, which are some of the features that make C so fun and exciting. Like rawdogging a one night stand!
