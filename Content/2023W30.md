Musk stans 3 months ago: "LOL, tooting sounds so dumb!"

> Today marks the 80th anniversary of the start of Operation GOMORRAH, the 10-day Anglo-American campaign of day and night bombing of Hamburg. It’s an anniversary that ought to be remembered and mostly won’t be. A thread.

> To understand Musk's renewed obsession with X and focus on financial services, you REALLY need to understand the X/Confinity merger that became PayPal.

> And, particularly, the Peter Thiel-led coup that kicked Musk out as CEO/Chief Strategist.

> Here's how that happened.  1/🧵

The parallels between Felon Husk and Andrew Lee of Freenode infamy grow stronger day by day.

### "Did Rome fall due to dysgenics?" - buncha racists just asking questions

> Before this gets too much attention, let's take a closer look. TLDR: this paper is total bullshit, and the authors are dangerous pseudo-intellectuals (at best).

> I’ll start with the science: a short thread (trying to avoid being sued): 🧵

> Longer response to this forthcoming, but in the meantime, let me just say as someone who works on the population genetics of Ancient Rome and the applicability of polygenic scores to ancient DNA data this study isn’t scientifically sound - and it’s full of dog whistles.

Tried applying styling via XSLT to my Atom feed, couldn't get it to work, realized it's not 2005 anymore and went on to do more productive things.

Nix is the new Arch by the way.

Twitter going dark mode only will confuse so many boomers 🤣

#### [📺&#x1F1F8;&#x1F1EA; Springfloden SE01 (2016)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5194410/)

Precis som i SF finns det hårdhetsgrader i kriminaldraman, och ett där svensk polis skickar en fd. kriminell på hemligt uppdrag till Costa Rica, där han dödar 2 personer i självförsvar, tillhör definitivt den mjukare delen av skalan.

Serien kan också ses som en inlaga i debatten om nya Slussen, då den ursprungliga anläggningen presenteras som ett tillhåll för hemlösa, tiggare samt grovt kriminella. 

Skådespeleri och scenografi tillhör SVT-toppklass men manus är rent kolportage.

#### [🔗🐦🦞 The social network formerly known as Twitter banned from lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/c/6dj8lf)

> [...] the quality of links submitted to Twitter has noticeably declined in the last year. This has been frustrating and prompted a lot of removed stories, but never quite worth banning a site over.

> A few days ago Twitter’s owner overruled their Trust and Safety team to [restore a user who posted CSAM](https://www.techdirt.com/2023/07/27/elons-zero-tolerance-policy-on-csam-apparently-does-not-apply-to-conspiracy-theorist-accounts-he-likes/), which I guess answered that open question [whether Twitter/X tolerates CSAM content]. Linking to a site with an infamous and growing problem with CSAM has become unacceptably dangerous to this site.

> I’m banning the domains `twitter.com` and `x.com` (the in-progress rebrand). Because of Twitter’s CSAM problem, please also don’t link to Twitter via Nitter, Thread Reader App, or other alternative frontends.
