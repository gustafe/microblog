### Meta note on timestamps

I have discovered once again that the timestamp scheme I came up with when I created feed support was not optimal (The design principle was "LOL YOLO"). So I've changed it and thus (probably) updated all entries in all feed readers. Sorry about that. I hope it won't happen again.

> Sacks is quietly becoming the leading practitioner of a new right-wing sensibility that has emerged in the political realignments provoked by Trumpism and the pandemic. On foreign policy, it offers a blend of isolationism, Trumpist nationalism, suspicion of the deep state, and the anti-empire realism of John Mearsheimer. Domestically, the vision is more muddled, a series of angry poses, a politics of pique, much of it playing out on Twitter, Callin, YouTube, Rumble, Substack, and other online media, especially among people who may have once counted themselves on the left but now can’t countenance the sight of homeless encampments.

### Ghost in the Shell thoughts

GitS was mentioned on lobste.rs. I'm maybe not a superfan of the franchise but I believe it stands head and shoulders over most other manga/anime fare. But that's because I really like material like *Patlabor* and *Planetes*.

I was late to GitS, I checked out the manga in English translation around 10 years ago from the awesome local library. I've watched both the "rebooted" movie and the original (better!) and the SAC series (great!). I've even tried to read the 1.5 manga, which sucks. 

If I'd discovered it during the 80s when cyberpunk was new and fresh... I dunno. I kinda like the technofetishist sidebars in the manga but if you've read you Gibson it's not really that new. It's weird to me how cyberpunk has become an aesthetic now. 

Anyway, GitS is fun in that Japanese way in that the main arc of SAC season 1 is basically just political corruption. There's no "take over the world" as in so much media now. Section 9 is a police unit (albeit vigilantic) and the show is a detective show.

Classic "trading memory for speed" implementation, Perl version:

> Perl implements lists with an array and first/last element offsets. The array is allocated larger than needed with the offsets originally pointing in the middle of the array so there is room to grow in both directions (unshifts and pushes/inserts) before a re-allocation of the underlying array is necessary. The consequence of this implementation is that all of perl's primitive list operators (insertion, fetching, determining array size, push, pop, shift, unshift, etc.) perform in O(1) time.

#### [🔗 The legacies of the Ottoman Empire](https://archive.ph/Qufoh)

> Darke’s laudatory comments, however, will be welcomed in some parts of contemporary Turkey, where nostalgia for the Ottomans extends not only to hit TV series but to mainstream political debate that frames the end of empire as a disaster orchestrated by malign forces from afar. There has been talk of appealing to a “neo-Ottomanism” in foreign policy as a means of restoring the prestige of Turkey and the Turks, but also as a counterbalance to the perceived shortcomings of US and western policy across the Middle East.

> This strikes a chord with the cocktail of nostalgia and imperialism that is being mixed in other quarters too, especially those that are heirs to crumbled empires. The most obvious parallel, of course, is Russia, where Vladimir Putin is the cheerleader of a chorus clamouring for the restoration of past glories and the re-incorporation of peoples who were once subject to the whims of rulers in faraway capitals. Something similar is afoot in Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s Turkey, where the Ottoman Empire is seen through the rosiest of tinted spectacles, as a benign entity that brought peace and harmony to all its citizens.

> When it comes to speech, this means that fascists often seem to think that fascists can say anything, and *non-fascists have to listen to them*.

> [...] Musk bought Twitter because he honestly believes that free speech means everyone else has to listen to and accept the torrents of racism and antisemitism his supporters have unleashed in celebration of his purchase of Twitter.

So first off, the Twitter gray check thing they launched yesterday, to differentiate the *real* verified accounts from the soon to be scammy blue checks, was cancelled by Chairman Elon in a single reply tweet.

Then Binance, the biggest crypto exchange in the world, decided *not* to buy troubled <strike>next-biggest</strike> 3rd largest exchange FTX, leaving boy billionaire SBF high and dry and probably opening for further bloodbaths in crapto.

Third, the GOP didn't manage to swell more than a gentle ripple in the midterms and his sycophantic coverers are saying Former President Cheeto-dust is bigly mad at his awful candidates bombing, and the elders in the party are sharpening the long knives in favor of horrible ball of human lard DeSantis.

The problem is that FTX took its customers’ money and traded it for a pile of magic beans, and now the beans are worthless and there’s a huge hole in the balance sheet.

### 🐘The R-word, and replacements

People moving accounts from Twitter to the Fediverse (mostly Mastodon) have been semi-jokingly calling themselves "Twitter refugees". From a certain perspective, it seems to fit - you've arrived in a new "country" and aren't sure you'll fit in.

Plenty of people have pointed out that relatively privileged social media users describing themselves as refugees is insulting to *real* refugees, whose problems dwarf those of people losing their followers and likes.

A better term would be "mid-term school transfer" - there's still a giant support system around you, you just have to adjust to a new social circle.

Anyway, I had "refugee" in my pinned post but removed it in favor of "Twitter quiet quitter". I think the original concept of "quiet quitting"[1] was overblown and probably not real, but for this case it works. I still visit Twitter to see the car wreck from the front seats, but I don't interact as much as I did. I'm basically costing Twitter more than I give back and that's fine by me.

[1] basically, in an American context , not going above and beyond the job description.

Hence Russian politicians and propagandists seek the power of Ukrainian resistance somewhere beyond Ukraine, or indeed beyond reality: in conspiracies of Nazis, Jews, gays, and Satanists.  In these fantasies, no one ever has to ask what Russia is or might be, what Russian culture might represent, since it is defined as opposition to a phantom.

<h3> 🇸🇪  Intressanta debattartiklar om somliga kyrkors syn på HBTQ-personer</h3>

Från min egen läsning har den evangeliska rörelsen i USA tappat en stor del av yngre människor bland annat genom behandlingen av HBTQ-personer. 

Från Arbetet.se.

[Tomas Hemstad: Joel Halldorf förstår inte skadan frikyrkorna gjort mot hbtq-samhället](https://arbetet.se/2022/11/15/joel-halldorf-forstar-inte-skadan-frikyrkorna-gjort-mot-hbtq-samhallet/)

> För några veckor sedan, på väg från en minneshögtid för en vän på vad som här poetiskt kallas Hibernia Beach, mitt i San Franciscos bögtäta Castro-område, stötte vi ihop med en trevlig ung man på en bar. <br/><br/>Han berättade att han i sena tonåren, efter att ha kommit ut, blivit avsläppt i San Francisco av sina mor- eller farföräldrar som varit hans trygghetssystem. “De är kristna”, lägger han till, och ingen vidare förklaring behövs. <br/><br/> Ibland heter det “de är katoliker” eller “de är evangelikala” men andemeningen är densamma: de accepterar mig inte, vill inte veta av mig om jag inte gör våld mot mig själv för att förändras.<br/><br/>Det är en så vanlig historia i USA att den knappt registrerar på sorglighetsskalan.

[Lina Landström i replik: ”Tomas Hemstad förstår inte kyrkans roll i hbtq-personers liv”](https://arbetet.se/2022/11/16/tomas-hemstad-forstar-inte-kyrkans-roll-i-hbtq-personers-liv/)

> Liksom hbtq-communityt består av en salig blandning människor, så finns också en salig blandning kyrkor med olika teologier. Hemstad skriver: ”Frikyrkorna – pingströrelsen i allra högsta grad inkluderad – har gjort hbtq-samhället oerhörd skada över åren.” <br/><br/>Påståendet i sådant är inte osant, men det visar på Hemstads okunskap när det gäller vilka frikyrkorna är. Frikyrkorna inkluderar också Norrmalmskyrkan, idag en del av Equmeniakyrkan, som redan 1971 tog ställning för homosexuella. <br/><br/>När den moderna hbtq-rörelsen tog form i USA på 1970-talet stängdes de ute från alla samhällsinstanser, men då öppnade kyrkor dörrarna och lät hbtq-organisationerna få hålla sina möten i kyrkornas församlingslokaler.

### 🐘🐝 The buzz around Hive 

I'm not surprised the app Hive is getting traction among the masses fleeing Elmo's dumpster fire. It's slicker than fedi, there's *one* service to sign up for, not a plethora of instances with weird rules.[1]

And you know what? I think a commercialized service is what can absorb the flood right now. Especially if it's aligned with the values of Twitter (such as they are). There's an impedance mismatch between Twitter culture and Fedi culture that's going to be hard to overcome. A service that's prepared to monetize the traffic, pay for moderation, handle DMCA violation etc. is probably a better fit. 

Anywhoo I got an account there to squat my nick but I won't use the service.

[1] I know there are doubts if Hive is really on the up and up, see these threads

### ⏰🖥 Bye-bye, leap seconds

So apparently Big Computer has bullied Smol Astronomy (and Russia[1]) to stop adding/subtracting leap seconds to [UTC][wiki-utc] to keep it within one second of [UT1][wiki-ut1]. I'm sentimentally attached to the idea that local noon should be as close to the actual time when the sun is highest, but the reality is that most people probably don't live in a civil timezone where that happens (hi, France and Spain!) and DST changes mess that up even more.
